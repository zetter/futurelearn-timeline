So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.</p>\n\n<p>This two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals. researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.</p>\n\n<p>Delivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines and effect behaviour change. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:</p>\n\n<p>1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines</p>\n\n<p>2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.</p>\n\n<p>The learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"success-and-feedback-from-the-course\">Success and Feedback from the Course</h2>\n\n<p>In April 2014 over 5,000 learners registered on this course from across the world.

There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic.</p>\n\n<p>This course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade.  This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities.  Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested</p>\n\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n\n<p><em>Islamic Practice</em> An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam.</p>\n\n<p><em>History of Islam in Britain</em> An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Settlement Patterns</em> The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cultural Diversity</em> Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today.</p>\n\n<p><em>Contemporary Debates</em> An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold.</p>\n\n<p>Given current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The course will also include an exciting opportunity to join us live via web streaming for the IslamUK Centre’s Public Lecture Series each week as a series of leading scholars address key topics in depth.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more, read Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/muslims-in-britain-exploring-diversity-and-challenging-stereotypes/\">Muslims in Britain: exploring diversity and challenging stereotypes</a>.”</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray (Educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/","name":"Cardiff University"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2296530/video","runs":[{"uuid":"0b4c9035-3187-4a9f-ad64-05717bd3dcba","start_date":"2014-03-10","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"41d70f04-b88b-4fca-ac7e-e241d2731ea2","start_date":"2015-02-09","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"78f027e1-0a44-45ee-b54a-f5ebf3a5b5a2","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeares-hamlet?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e9/95/regular_e9953aa7-9c18-4279-8e84-6db2d24652e2.jpg","name":"Shakespeare's Hamlet: Text, Performance and Culture","introduction":"Experts from the Shakespeare Institute guide an exploration of the most famous play ever staged.","description":"<p>Hamlet is the most famous play ever written and the masterpiece of the most important writer in English, William Shakespeare.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.”<br>\nAgha Hasan Abedi</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet”<br>\nHenry Mintzberg</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\">Who is this course for?</h3>\n<p>The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial.</p>\n\n<p>The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-might-i-learn-and-how-might-this-benefit-me\">What might I learn and how might this benefit me?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to manage people and get them engaged.</li>\n  <li>How to get the best out of people.</li>\n  <li>What good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection.</li>\n  <li>Tools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-will-the-learning-experience-be-like-and-what-will-be-expected-of-me\">What will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me?</h3>\n<p>The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience.</p>\n\n<p>You must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches.

The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the factors that determine the survival of evidence</li>\n  <li>the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation</li>\n  <li>the planning of archaeological projects</li>\n  <li>excavation techniques</li>\n  <li>and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome’s most famous frontier.</p>\n\n<p>Find out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/how-learners-are-helping-shape-our-courses-about-hadrians-wall\">FutureLearn blog</a>.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"Ian Haynes (Lead Educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.ncl.ac.uk","name":"Newcastle University"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2317804/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f8ffa395-10ff-4d0f-b819-533e0f0d29ad","start_date":"2014-09-22","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"88d5a221-9dba-4f28-9209-c1de6d214f2e","start_date":"2015-06-15","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"932a1232-1b0c-4f92-9b7d-91fd29df9149","start_date":"2015-11-02","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"5a54bae0-e90e-45ce-bd2f-c5c3cff77d07","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mental-health-and-well-being?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/22/29/regular_2229c235-75ed-4f5d-b8da-90bc2f4c6506.jpg","name":"Psychology and Mental Health: Beyond Nature and Nurture","introduction":"Learn how a psychological understanding of our emotions and behaviour gives us new ways to improve mental health and well-being.","description":"<p>Psychological therapies and the work of clinical psychologists are now very popular.

This course is a first step to develop yourself into one of the future’s key decision makers or to enhance your decision-making skills.</p>\n\n<p>First, this course will address what complexity is and will define uncertainty. Next, we cover a number of tools and methods to understand and be able to navigate through the complex and uncertain world.</p>\n\n<p>The need for a multidisciplinary approach will be emphasised throughout the course. Guest lecturers from different faculties will explain, provide applications and examples from their respective fields of study for a more comprehensive understanding of the different elements of complexity. For example, complexity can be beautifully explained by the use of insects and brains and many other natural and social phenomena. The same ideas can be applied to economic and financial systems.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modeling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently leadership and entrepreneurship. Finally, relating this all back together in two case studies will conclude the course.

The war began in the Balkans, but it soon spread to become a European conflict, and developed into a world war.</p>\n\n<p>It was a war of unprecedented scale and brutality, with countless casualties. It also left a poisonous legacy for the 20th century and beyond, and many of the issues that were left unresolved in 1918 would lead to another world war in 1939. 1914-1918 was a period in history that has proved provocative and culturally resonant for the last hundred years.</p>\n\n<p>On this free online course, you will study the subject of physical and mental trauma, its treatments and its representation. You will focus not only on the trauma experienced by combatants but also the effects of World War 1 on civilian populations.</p>\n\n<p>Over three weeks, you will discover just how devastating the effects of World War 1 were in terms of casualties across the many combatant nations, and look in depth at the problem of “shell shock” and how deeply it affected the lives of those who lived through it. You will also develop the skills to carry out your own independent research.</p>\n\n<p>The war was not only experienced on the battlefield, however, and you’ll explore the many and varied ways in which civilians’ lives were affected by it. For example, in the way combatant casualties affected the lives of loved ones who were left behind.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, you will look at how the trauma of World War 1 has been depicted in art and literature, and see what has been learned from the past in the modern day treatment of combat stress reactions and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>\n\n<p>For a taste of what will be covered in this course, read a post from lead educator, Annika Mombauer, on our blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/remembrance-sunday\">Remembrance Sunday: how World War 1 changed the way we mourn the dead</a>.”</p>\n\n<p>This course is part of a series designed in partnership with the BBC to commemorate the war.

Many inherited conditions and acquired infections can also cause liver disease, and liver disease as a consequence of obesity and diet is becoming especially significant.</p>\n\n<p>This course will teach you about the amazing roles the liver fulfils to keep you healthy and will show you how these functions are compromised when the liver is damaged.

You’ll consider and discuss the latest solutions and concepts on urban design and modelling, climate change adaptation, behaviour change, and social and government engagement.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, you’ll consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the emerging challenges facing our cities</li>\n  <li>how water sensitive cities can be the driver for more resilient cities</li>\n  <li>how water can be managed in our cities to improve their liveability</li>\n  <li>the potential for stormwater, urban aquatic systems, and green infrastructure to improve the urban climate</li>\n  <li>how changes in human behaviour and institutions can complement and assist transitions to water sensitive cities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We’ll focus on effective ways to create water sensitive cities as we draw upon case studies from Australia and around the world. We’ll challenge you to consider how you can help make your urban environment more water sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more in Robert Skinner’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/water-sensitive-cities/\">Can water help our cities cope with rapid urbanization and climate change?</a>”</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment"],"educator":"Robert Skinner (Lead Educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.monash.edu.au","name":"Monash University"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2131245/video","runs":[{"uuid":"651bf2af-4dc1-4e86-815f-dd9703860c71","start_date":"2015-03-02","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"00ecd7b1-32ed-46d5-9f70-f1df14bf5438","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shale-gas?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/3c/ac/regular_3caca682-b4ac-4240-8621-d58a9c0ac586.jpg","name":"Shale Gas and Fracking: the Politics and Science","introduction":"Hear from all sides of the fracking debate with this free online course. Understand what shale gas is and why it divides opinion.","description":"<p>Shale gas is seen by many as a cheap, clean and plentiful source of energy; a low-carbon ‘game changer’ helping us meet the world’s rapidly growing demands for energy and offering greater energy security. Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.</p>\n\n<p>During this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We’ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.</p>\n\n<p>We then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?</p>\n\n<p>Finally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you will have improved you understanding of the costs and benefits of shale gas, and you will have made your contribution to the public debate on this important topic.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with announcements and discussions by following the course on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaleGas_MOOC\">@ShaleGas_MOOC</a>.

According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.</p>\n\n<p>Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East.

In the past, genetic testing was limited to sequencing one gene at a time. However, next generation sequencing technologies permit the parallel sequencing of many or all genes.</p>\n\n<p>While these new technologies have greatly enhanced the chances of diagnosis for rare conditions; are beginning to provide a real chance of personalised medicine; and, in time, are likely to improve our understanding and treatment of complex disease, they are also associated with a number of challenges.</p>\n\n<p>These challenges include a much greater chance of identifying genomic variants, the significance of which can be uncertain; the identification of incidental findings; genomic privacy; and the storage and use of big data sets.</p>\n\n<p>In this new genomic era, it is essential that healthcare professionals understand the power and all the challenges associated with the information generated by these new multiple parallel sequencing technologies, in order to make appropriate referrals and evidence-based management decisions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"discover-the-potential-of-genetics-in-healthcare\">Discover the potential of genetics in healthcare</h3>\n\n<p>This course will give you an awareness of genomic technologies and the data they generate. With ready access to genomic data promised by NHS transformational initiatives such as the <a href=\"http://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/the-100000-genomes-project\">100,000 Genomes Project</a>, genomic data will be integral to all sectors of medicine and will be used in the prevention, diagnosis and personalised treatment of human disease.</p>\n\n<p>During this course, you will learn how to utilise these genomic results for patient benefit and without compromising patient safety.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-with-experts-in-clinical-genetics-and-education\">Learn with experts in clinical genetics and education</h3>\n\n<p>The course draws on the experience of experts in clinical genetics and education at <a href=\"https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk\">St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sgul.ac.uk/\">St George’s, University of London</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.genomicseducation.hee.nhs.uk\">Genomics Education Programme from Health Education England</a>.</p>\n\n<p>St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is a founding member of the Genomics Network Alliance, recognised by NHS England as a <a href=\"https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/newsitem/south-london-nhs-genomics-medicine-centre-announced/\">Genomic Medicine Centre</a>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-the-role-of-clinical-geneticists\">Understand the role of clinical geneticists</h3>\n\n<p>As clinical geneticists, who undertake diagnosis and care of patients with genetic conditions on a regular basis, the course educators are able to explain the role of novel technologies, and explore how the technologies - and the data they generate - are relevant to clinical practice both now and in the future.</p>\n\n<p>The educators are also very familiar with the challenges associated with the use of genomic technologies and will discuss these with you during the course.

Chain Innovation: How Technology Can Create a Sustainable Future","introduction":"Understand how new technologies can make supply chains more sustainable and learn how to deal with today's trends. ","description":"<p>Every product that we use today is the result of a supply chain - a complex series of steps that turn raw materials into the final products we use and everything related with this. Managing these supply chains has become more and more a challenge, especially with all modern technologies and todays trends. The 24-hour economy, fast delivery of goods to your home, wanting to have customized products and of course the focus on sustainability are a few of these trends.</p>\n\n<p>In this course you will learn why managing supply chains is important and challenging. It is a key activity for both large multi-national companies as well as for small businesses. We’ll find out how to design supply chains that meet future economic, environmental and social requirements, asking questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How did global supply chain become what they are today?</li>\n  <li>How can current information and communication technology (ICT) make supply chains more efficient?</li>\n  <li>Which trends do we need to recognize and cope with?</li>\n  <li>How can you implement sustainable supply chain innovations?</li>\n  <li>And what impact will sensing technologies, such as the use of RFID, have on the supply chain?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will look at examples from the food industry. Also, the building and construction supply chain will be discussed since it has a big impact. One out of three trucks is construction related so innovations applied on this chain can have a huge impact.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be encouraged to apply the knowledge you gain to your own product or industry (or a company and supply chain you’re interested in). You are invited to share your ideas for optimizing your supply chain with other learners.</p>\n\n<p>Together with academics from the University of Twente and experts from industry, you’ll learn how to innovate supply chains. These instructors have vast experience in integrating ICT and extensive research in supply chain process optimization, innovation and management.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Jos Van Hillegersberg","organisation":{"url":"http://www.utwente.nl/en/","name":"University of Twente"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5282692/video","runs":[{"uuid":"4eee6279-03f8-4030-a1b4-18b39fa58f32","start_date":"2016-01-11","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"423f4b09-e97a-4687-8e31-9bbb3631909c","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/84/b6/regular_84b6a8b0-d253-4b29-982a-97e3f608c85c.jpg","name":"Hans Christian Andersen’s Fairy Tales","introduction":"Explore the fairy tale world of HC Andersen - the inspiration behind The Little Mermaid and Frozen - with this free online course.","description":"<p>This free online course will introduce you to some of Hans Christian Andersen’s most popular fairy tales, share the story of the writer himself, and discuss his cross-cultural importance today, as the inspiration behind many popular books and movies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"interpret-hans-christian-andersens-fairy-tales-with-experts-from-his-birthplace\">Interpret Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales with experts from his birthplace</h3>\n\n<p>You will learn with experts from the HC Andersen Center at the University of Southern Denmark – an internationally renowned research institution located in the writer’s birthplace, Odense.</p>\n\n<p>Each week, these experts will guide a discussion, analysis and interpretation of one of Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The Tinderbox</li>\n  <li>The Travelling Companion</li>\n  <li>The Little Mermaid</li>\n  <li>The Snow Queen (the inspiration for Disney’s Frozen)</li>\n  <li>The Story of a Mother</li>\n  <li>The Red Shoes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You will explore the themes of each story, and investigate how they both conform with and digress from the fairy tale.

Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You’ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also look at the structure of the virus in more detail, seeing how the study of influenza is now carried out at the molecular level.</p>\n\n<p>As well as mini-lectures, there will be laboratory demonstrations, interviews with experts in a variety of relevant fields, and discussion sessions, where you’ll be invited to contribute your own experiences and opinions to the subject of flu, and how we should treat and prevent it.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":false,"categories":["Health & Psychology"],"educator":"Derek Gatherer (lead educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk","name":"Lancaster University"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5438335/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f46f875c-3321-43c3-b934-aac793c9959d","start_date":"2016-01-18","duration_in_weeks":2}]},{"uuid":"8d5ae40c-c221-4a68-a78b-cc374fed3da8","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/military-ethics?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f2/02/regular_f2020743-f023-4d3a-bac1-fafa5907d58f.jpg","name":"Military Ethics: An Introduction","introduction":"We explore the ethical responsibilities that weigh on military professionals, who are ‘managers of violence’.","description":"<p>Military professionals are unusual in having the use of lethal force as a central, defining feature of their role, and unique in the level of force that they are authorized to use. This fact places a considerable ethical weight on military practitioners as well as the civilian decision-makers who authorize military missions.</p>\n\n<p>The military profession is also unique in having a dedicated ethical framework associated with it, Just War Theory. This defines the conditions for when it is justified for a party to resort to war, the requirements for ethical conduct within the bounds of a war or armed conflict, and the conditions for a just ending to war.</p>\n\n<p>The ethical challenges that military professionals face do not, however, begin and end with the use of force.

Throughout, we will focus on the experiences of soldiers in the British, French, German and American armies, as these formed the majority of soldiers on the Western Front. This includes soldiers from the British and French empires, including Australian, Canadian, Indian, New Zealand, Algerian, Moroccan and West African soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn with John Connor, one of Australia’s leading military historians, and a team of international historians.

We concentrate on the conflict on the Western Front, and explore the development of an unprecedented type of combat, trench warfare.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: The ‘learning curve’</strong>. In this section we compare how the British, French and German armies attempted to end the stalemate of trench warfare by developing new technology, training and tactics.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: Remembering the First World War</strong>. We explore how the social and political landscape has shaped and changed the memory of the War over the last century, and how art, poetry and novels have contributed to that understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Image credit: with permission from <a href=\"http://digital.nls.uk/74548990\">National Library of Scotland</a>.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"John Connor","organisation":{"url":"http://www.unsw.edu.au/","name":"UNSW Australia"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5356990/video","runs":[{"uuid":"3fed39b5-cdf3-46fa-b325-0d36e9d8a5f7","start_date":"2016-02-08","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"fb71a629-2346-42c8-92a2-9c9746b3c3d2","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/crime-justice-society?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/a4/08/regular_a4085e9b-8156-4c36-b135-378813639661.jpg","name":"Crime, Justice and Society ","introduction":"Explore the role of the state and criminal justice interventions in producing safe and just societies\r\n","description":"<p>Crime and criminal justice are vast and fascinating issues that highlight the complexity of defining and solving social problems.</p>\n\n<p>What traditional and innovative responses to crime and victimisation work?

The material used dissolves in the body, giving the boy’s bronchus time to grow strong, before disappearing, without the need for surgery.</p>\n\n<p>This incredible story is an early example of a new clinical paradigm in biomedicine: 3D bioprinting.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"discover-what-3d-bioprinting-can-do-now-and-in-the-future\">Discover what 3D bioprinting can do now and in the future</h3>\n\n<p>This free online course tells the story of this revolution, introducing you to commonly used biomaterials, including metals, ceramics and polymers, and how bioprinting techniques, such as selective laser melting, hot-melt extrusion and inkjet printing, work. Through case studies - ranging from hip implants to facial transplants to lab-grown organs - we’ll answer questions such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What is 3D printing and how did it come about?</li>\n  <li>Is it really possible to print structures that incorporate both living and artificial components?</li>\n  <li>How long before we can print whole body organs for transplants?</li>\n  <li>What is possible right now, and what will be possible in 20 and 50 years’ time?</li>\n  <li>And what are the limitations of this technology?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This course will also equip and encourage you to become part of the story.
