In Northern Ireland, throughout the peace process, contestation over flags, parades and memorials has been frequent.  As South Africa developed a new democracy the management of demonstrations by the police became a key issue. Eastern European countries in the post-soviet era have slowly come to terms with the rights of diverse political groups to express their political opinions in public spaces. And post-9/11, western democracies have struggled to define public space for their large Muslim communities.</p>\n\n<p>How is freedom of expression managed in highly divided societies, particularly when they have a history of political violence?</p>\n\n<p>This course will start by looking at the nature of social groups and the importance of identity and public spaces in politics around the world (for example the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement, Civil Rights Movements). It will then examine why understanding public space is important through looking at symbols, parades and memorials. The course will examine well documented examples, focusing on the learning that has arisen from the Northern Ireland peace process. It will explore the role of human rights and public policy. It will conclude by returning to the comparative frame to examine key lessons for understanding conflict transformation in divided societies.</p>\n\n<p>This course will give you the opportunity to purchase a <a href=\"http://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/?category=statements-of-participation\">Statement of Participation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the hashtag <strong>#FLidentity</strong> to join and contribute to social media conversations about this course.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Dominic Bryan (Educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.qub.ac.uk/","name":"Queen's University Belfast"},"runs":[{"uuid":"096f6c23-2b0d-4ee1-acaf-87656fc39485","start_date":"2014-04-28","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"a696ce88-a6ce-4530-bd55-c4559ce1e544","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/innovation-and-enterprise?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","name":"Innovation and Enterprise","introduction":"Managing the innovation process is neither a scientific process nor a black art.

But perhaps the most obvious (and often overlooked) quality required of all sound engineers is the ability to listen. Sound engineers must constantly evaluate the sound quality of individual sound sources in a mix and evaluate how these sound sources interrelate with one another. The ability to listen critically and make these judgements is a skill that must be learnt through trial and error and repeated practice. This course aims to provide the student with tools for developing and refining the critical listening skills relevant to contemporary sound engineering and will be of interest to musicians, sound enthusiasts and experienced sound engineers alike.</p>\n\n<p>The course begins by examining the nature of sound and how properties of sound (frequency, amplitude and sound intensity, for example) are expressed. The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined. The remainder of the module focuses on the signal processing techniques commonly used by sound engineers when mixing multitrack recordings - for example, equalisation, compression and reverberation. On completion of the module, students will have a thorough understanding of the workflow involved when mixing a multitrack recording and will have developed the critical listening skills necessary to make informed judgments regarding individual and overall sound quality.</p>\n\n<p>Course duration: 7 weeks</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media"],"educator":"Chris Corrigan","organisation":{"url":"http://www.qub.ac.uk/","name":"Queen's University Belfast"},"runs":[{"uuid":"03567a18-0ee1-4ea6-abbf-cf4aff8f93a5","start_date":"2014-01-13","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"a68188df-85c9-4d1b-9d8c-f74661f7cf54","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-modern-business-and-organisations?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","name":"Understanding Modern Business and Organisations","introduction":"Learn how knowledge, technology, ethics and globalisation affect businesses today, with this free online course for graduates.","description":"<p>Are you a graduate who’s new to the world of work?

","description":"<p>People have explored and depended on the oceans of our planet for millennia. During that time the geography of our world has changed radically as coastal regions have flooded and islands have risen up, or been lost beneath the waves. With 70% of the world’s surface covered by water, an unparalleled, yet largely untouched record of human life has been left beneath the sea for us to discover, from our earliest ancestors right through to present day. Over the length of this ‘Shipwrecks and Submerged Worlds’ course we will learn about maritime archaeology together - exploring underwater landscapes from the ancient Mediterranean to the prehistoric North Sea, and consider Shipwrecks from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific coast of the Americas.</p>\n\n<p>We will introduce you to the pioneers of the discipline and explain what maritime archaeology is and why it is relevant today.

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding”, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you’ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you’ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>We will also look at how a number of leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them.</p>\n\n<p>The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Can a computer be independently creative?</li>\n  <li>Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program?</li>\n  <li>How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology?</li>\n  <li>Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>You can use the hashtag <strong>#FLCreativeCoding</strong> to join and contribute to Twitter conversations about this course.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media","Online & Digital"],"educator":"Jon McCormack (Educator)","organisation":{"url":"http://www.monash.edu.au","name":"Monash University"},"runs":[{"uuid":"f420a6e2-9dd9-4886-9dff-15061f598bde","start_date":"2014-06-02","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"be3575ea-d399-40da-8f88-39e043e84794","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/physical-theatre?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","name":"Physical Theatre: Meyerhold and Biomechanics","introduction":"Learn how to practice Meyerhold’s biomechanics and study its place in the history of physical theatre.","description":"<p>This short three-week course introduces you to world-renowned Russian director Meyerhold’s technique of biomechanics, inviting you to experience first-hand his revolutionary approach to acting – the biomechanical études.

Meyerhold’s work will be placed in context as an early collaborator with Stanislavsky and a contemporary of Michael Chekhov. You will be introduced to one of his études – a two minute repeatable exercise used to develop balance, awareness and expression. Responding to video guidance you will be invited to explore your own response to this unique approach to training and will share these with the experts and your fellow students.

Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science.

Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period.

The war began in the Balkans, but it soon spread to become a European conflict, and developed into a world war.</p>\n\n<p>It was a war of unprecedented scale and brutality, with countless casualties. It also left a poisonous legacy for the 20th century and beyond, and many of the issues that were left unresolved in 1918 would lead to another world war in 1939. 1914-1918 was a period in history that has proved provocative and culturally resonant for the last hundred years.</p>\n\n<p>On this free online course, you will study the subject of physical and mental trauma, its treatments and its representation.

Understand what shale gas is and why it divides opinion.","description":"<p>Shale gas is seen by many as a cheap, clean and plentiful source of energy; a low-carbon ‘game changer’ helping us meet the world’s rapidly growing demands for energy and offering greater energy security. Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.</p>\n\n<p>During this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We’ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.</p>\n\n<p>We then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?</p>\n\n<p>Finally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you will have improved you understanding of the costs and benefits of shale gas, and you will have made your contribution to the public debate on this important topic.</p>\n\n<p>This course will give you the opportunity to purchase a <a href=\"http://about.futurelearn.com/about/faq/?category=statements-of-participation\">Statement of Participation</a></p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with announcements and discussions by following the course on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaleGas_MOOC\">@ShaleGas_MOOC</a>.

According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.</p>\n\n<p>Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will have acquired the knowledge and analytical skills to develop critical insights into one of the most urgent issues of today’s world: the various roles of religion in conflicts.

They will take you on a journey, across the battlefields on which the war was fought and into the homes of the ordinary people who suffered it. Amongst the cast of the 100 stories are not just soldiers, sailors, airmen and nurses, but parents who lost their sons, wives who struggled with shell-shocked husbands, children who never knew their fathers.  The themes these stories explore - grief and suffering, hope, anguish and loss - are universal.  They are told in a language everyone can understand and are based on archives only just opened to historians.</p>\n\n<p>Each week we’ll examine a different topic, including the physical and psychological wounds of war- shell shock, disability and trauma; women’s mobilisation both at home and in the field; and what we’ve called ‘the other Anzac’: indigenous soldiers too often ignored in our history.  We’ll examine grief and mourning; protest and repatriation, the politics of war and its intensely personal dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll hear from leading historians in the field, and together we’ll debate the meanings of the stories.
