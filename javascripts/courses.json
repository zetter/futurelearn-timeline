","description":"<p>Programming is everywhere: in dishwashers, cars and even space shuttles. This course will help you to understand how programs work and guide you through creating your own computer program – a mobile game.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re a complete newcomer to programming, or have some basic skills, this course provides a challenging but fun way to start programming in Java. Over seven weeks we will introduce the basic constructs that are used in many programming languages and help you to put this knowledge into practice by changing the game code we have provided. You’ll have the freedom to create a game that’s unique to you, with support from the community and educators if you get stuck. You’ll learn how to create algorithms to solve problems and translate these into code, using the same tools as industry professionals worldwide. We will be using Google’s Android Studio as the platform for programming.</p>\n\n<p>The course will combine video introductions, on-screen examples, downloadable guides, articles and discussions to help you understand the principles behind computer programs and the building blocks that are used to create them. Multiple choice quizzes will help you to check your understanding, while exercises each week will show you how to use your new skills to improve your game.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you’ll have a complete game that can be played on an Android phone or tablet, or even your computer. You can share it with your friends and family, use your new knowledge to improve the game further, or even create new games of your own!</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more about this course in Professor Shirley Williams’s blog post on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/shortage-of-programmers/\">shortage of programmers</a>.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Online & Digital"],"educator":"Richard  Mitchell","organisation":{"url":"http://www.reading.ac.uk","name":"University of Reading","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/75/87/75874262-136f-472c-82b1-3bc71d8f9aa1.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8237800/video","runs":[{"uuid":"6f24cc01-d18f-42f8-b679-ed0830db5d32","start_date":"2013-10-28","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"2b3b6da3-6da7-4ae2-84fe-9ddf08f91327","start_date":"2014-02-24","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"ed6a9426-6518-453f-9a13-6e6b1b8779ca","start_date":"2014-10-20","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"cb65a9e4-7d83-49f0-bb4c-9e379e463e2d","start_date":"2015-02-16","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"f6b29062-4025-45eb-9b11-e92ba8b32ebf","start_date":"2015-06-01","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"2f93d0a0-1239-4ba2-9b5f-97593f2e9d1b","start_date":"2015-10-12","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"c8ab326b-731f-43cb-86ea-1f2e3137e91d","start_date":"2016-04-04","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"bd832dbe-eb1d-4318-9c8b-7f587eb04ec3","start_date":"2016-10-31","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"088fe01d-5438-402f-a3b1-7212ac334ca8","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/corpus-linguistics?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/33/9f/regular_339ff074-1f50-4a77-a9d8-822cf939be13.jpg","name":"Corpus Linguistics: Method, Analysis, Interpretation","introduction":"Offers a practical introduction to the methodology of corpus linguistics for researchers in social sciences and humanities","description":"<p>The course aims to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Equip those taking the course with skills necessary for collecting and analysing large digital collections of text (corpora).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Provide educational support for those who want to use the corpus method.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Demonstrate the use of corpus linguistics in the humanities, especially History.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Give a sense of the incredibly wide uses that corpora have been put to.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Allow those with an interest in language, who have not heard of the corpus approach before, a new way of looking at language.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Demonstrate that corpus approaches to social science can offer valuable insight into social reality by investigating the use and manipulation of language in society.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Literature","Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Tony McEnery","organisation":{"url":"http://www.lancaster.ac.uk","name":"Lancaster University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/47/74/47742afd-0804-4cb4-8a1e-7b228d84ca91.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1550630/video","runs":[{"uuid":"6c037c14-a837-437e-90b6-9735ec38add6","start_date":"2014-01-27","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"3aa3fe03-b71e-47d6-9c43-d829eba756ef","start_date":"2014-09-29","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"7ae542f8-bb34-4550-b0d4-34118b6ef0d2","start_date":"2015-09-28","duration_in_weeks":8},{"uuid":"6f383947-b4f9-4010-b26d-436b8dc78ba5","start_date":"2016-09-26","duration_in_weeks":8}]},{"uuid":"924b1510-c2f9-47a5-802e-7f3bfc8e9fdd","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/dental-photography-in-practice?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ab/4f/regular_ab4fe1b5-2203-48de-85fa-ad0b5275d473.jpg","name":"Improving Your Image: Dental Photography in Practice","introduction":"Learn how to achieve consistent and excellent results in all aspects of dental photography with this free online course.","description":"<p>This free course will cover all aspects of the use of digital photography in dental practice: intra-oral, extra-oral, and portraits.

So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.</p>\n\n<p>This two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals, researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.</p>\n\n<p>Delivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines and effect behaviour change. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:</p>\n\n<p>1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines</p>\n\n<p>2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.</p>\n\n<p>The learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"success-and-feedback-from-the-course\">Success and feedback from the course</h2>\n\n<p>Since April 2014 over 15,000 learners have registered on this course from across the world.

Established by Claudius and enlarged by the emperor Trajan with spoils of the Dacian wars, the port was the conduit for everything the city of Rome required from its Mediterranean provinces: the food and, particularly grain, that fed the largest urban population of the ancient world, as well as luxuries of all kinds, building materials, people and wild animals for the arena.</p>\n\n<p>On this course you will chart a journey from the Imperial harbour to its connections across the Mediterranean, learning about what the archaeological discoveries uncovered by the Portus Project tell us about the history, landscape, buildings, and the people of this unique place. Although the site lies in ruins, it has some of the best-preserved Roman port buildings in the Mediterranean, and in this course you will learn to interpret these and the finds discovered within them, using primary research data and the virtual tools of the archaeologist.</p>\n\n<p>Largely filmed on location at Portus, the course will provide you with an insight into the wide range of digital technologies employed to record, analyse and present the site.

This course has been developed as a result of what those international students told us, as well as the experience INTO UEA colleagues have in preparing international students for university study.</p>\n\n<p>Over the four weeks of the course you will hear top tips from international students already studying at university in the UK. You will also hear teachers talking about the key skills that international students need to do well. Our aim is to give you the best possible chance of success in your studies.</p>\n\n<p>Each week there will be videos, articles, quizzes and discussions that will help you develop your study skills.

Professor Chater’s central proposition will be  that there is no mental depth, that mental depth is an illusion.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"understand-mystifying-aspects-of-human-behaviour\">Understand mystifying aspects of human behaviour</h4>\n\n<p>This course consists of six weeks of material.

But perhaps the most obvious (and often overlooked) quality required of all sound engineers is the ability to listen.</p>\n\n<p>Sound engineers must constantly evaluate the sound quality of individual sound sources in a mix and evaluate how these sound sources interrelate with one another. The ability to listen critically and make these judgements is a skill that must be learnt through trial and error and repeated practice.

The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined. The remainder of the course focuses on the signal processing techniques commonly used by sound engineers when mixing multitrack recordings - for example, equalisation, compression and reverberation.</p>\n\n<p>On completion of the course you will have a thorough understanding of the workflow involved when mixing a multitrack recording and will have developed the critical listening skills necessary to make informed judgements regarding individual and overall sound quality.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media"],"educator":"Chris Corrigan","organisation":{"url":"http://www.qub.ac.uk/","name":"Queen's University Belfast","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/49/5f/495f6bdb-110c-4b8f-892f-daa8672097df.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1328584/video","runs":[{"uuid":"03567a18-0ee1-4ea6-abbf-cf4aff8f93a5","start_date":"2014-01-13","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"b536aa46-7885-4c2f-b128-a54c0efb2975","start_date":"2016-09-12","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"a68188df-85c9-4d1b-9d8c-f74661f7cf54","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/understanding-modern-business-and-organisations?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/7f/a3/regular_7fa33908-ff3d-43dc-8e6a-3fa05740c92a.jpg","name":"Understanding Modern Business and Organisations","introduction":"Learn how knowledge, technology, ethics and globalisation affect businesses today, with this free online course for graduates.","description":"<p>Are you a graduate who’s new to the world of work?

People are increasingly bombarded by dramatic and at times disturbing headlines. Yet general knowledge of Muslims and their faith can be poor. There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic.</p>\n\n<p>This course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade.  This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities.  Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested</p>\n\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n\n<p><em>Islamic Practice</em> An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam.</p>\n\n<p><em>History of Islam in Britain</em> An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Settlement Patterns</em> The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cultural Diversity</em> Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today.</p>\n\n<p><em>Contemporary Debates</em> An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold.</p>\n\n<p>Given current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The course will also include an exciting opportunity to join us live via web streaming for the IslamUK Centre’s Public Lecture Series each week as a series of leading scholars address key topics in depth.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more, read Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/muslims-in-britain-exploring-diversity-and-challenging-stereotypes/\">Muslims in Britain: exploring diversity and challenging stereotypes</a>.”</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/","name":"Cardiff University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/95/11/95118ca8-be03-43d0-b088-54dd1b16c014.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2296530/video","runs":[{"uuid":"0b4c9035-3187-4a9f-ad64-05717bd3dcba","start_date":"2014-03-10","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"41d70f04-b88b-4fca-ac7e-e241d2731ea2","start_date":"2015-02-09","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"930360fd-d77e-49c6-be63-37a12d129626","start_date":"2016-02-22","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"78f027e1-0a44-45ee-b54a-f5ebf3a5b5a2","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeares-hamlet?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e9/95/regular_e9953aa7-9c18-4279-8e84-6db2d24652e2.jpg","name":"Shakespeare's Hamlet: Text, Performance and Culture","introduction":"Experts from the Shakespeare Institute guide an exploration of the most famous play ever staged.","description":"<p>Hamlet is the most famous play ever written and the masterpiece of the most important writer in English, William Shakespeare.

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding,” this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression.</p>\n\n<p>So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this free online course extremely useful.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-the-concepts-and-skills-of-creative-coding\">Explore the concepts and skills of creative coding</h3>\n\n<p>Throughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.”<br>\nAgha Hasan Abedi</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet”<br>\nHenry Mintzberg</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\">Who is this course for?</h3>\n<p>The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial.</p>\n\n<p>The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future.

The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the factors that determine the survival of evidence</li>\n  <li>the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation</li>\n  <li>the planning of archaeological projects</li>\n  <li>excavation techniques</li>\n  <li>and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome’s most famous frontier.</p>\n\n<p>Find out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/how-learners-are-helping-shape-our-courses-about-hadrians-wall\">FutureLearn blog</a>.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"Ian Haynes","organisation":{"url":"http://www.ncl.ac.uk","name":"Newcastle University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e7/3a/e73a2f33-be3e-4e3f-9090-046353e05505.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2317804/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f8ffa395-10ff-4d0f-b819-533e0f0d29ad","start_date":"2014-09-22","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"88d5a221-9dba-4f28-9209-c1de6d214f2e","start_date":"2015-06-15","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"932a1232-1b0c-4f92-9b7d-91fd29df9149","start_date":"2015-11-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"dc0e03ec-4d4f-4bf9-aa2c-e24f6e8c0a77","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"5a54bae0-e90e-45ce-bd2f-c5c3cff77d07","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mental-health-and-well-being?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/22/29/regular_2229c235-75ed-4f5d-b8da-90bc2f4c6506.jpg","name":"Psychology and Mental Health: Beyond Nature and Nurture","introduction":"Learn how a psychological understanding of our emotions and behaviour gives us new ways to improve mental health and well-being.","description":"<p>Psychological therapies and the work of clinical psychologists are now very popular.

Next, we cover a number of tools and methods to understand and be able to navigate through the complex and uncertain world.</p>\n\n<p>The need for a multidisciplinary approach will be emphasised throughout the course. Guest lecturers from different faculties will explain, provide applications and examples from their respective fields of study for a more comprehensive understanding of the different elements of complexity. For example, complexity can be beautifully explained by the use of insects and brains and many other natural and social phenomena. The same ideas can be applied to economic and financial systems.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modelling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently entrepreneurship. Finally, relating this all back together in two case studies will conclude the course. The first case study is financial stability and crises and the latter is growth and development of cities.</p>\n\n<p>By completing this course you will have developed skills and knowledge that will enhance your decision-making skills in order to act in a complex world and under uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This course has received a major update in 2016 with added content on agent-based modelling, entrepreneurship and city planning.</strong></p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Lex Hoogduin","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7064059/video","runs":[{"uuid":"b9d01871-a3f9-45c9-994b-29461002cab6","start_date":"2014-09-15","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"1cd3114e-4a13-4157-9a1c-3a19fbf7e406","start_date":"2015-01-19","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"4445ee60-bb4f-456a-bfa2-bf0af1697ee5","start_date":"2015-09-21","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"5e7235b4-374e-4fcf-ac68-e67d3441909a","start_date":"2016-09-05","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"23c5b3a2-d869-4ec8-99a8-c5d5cf0854bf","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/football?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/90/2d/regular_902d0c48-095e-4919-81aa-4b8f4d3f198c.jpg","name":"Football: More than a Game","introduction":"Explore the role of football in the world today - including finances, clubs, nations and rivalries - with this free online course.","description":"<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, football was the most popular game in the western world and has since grown to become a global spectacle.</p>\n\n<p>From street soccer to multi-million dollar transfers, from the beaches of Brazil to the fight against poverty and inequality in Africa, this free online course looks beyond the pitch, to explore football’s role in society today.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"explore-footballs-role-in-society-today\">Explore football’s role in society today</h4>\n\n<p>Over six weeks, we will address several important questions, as we introduce you to different major aspects of the sport:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Why is the history of football important?</li>\n  <li>Is football played in every country in the world?

Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.</p>\n\n<p>During this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas.

We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.</p>\n\n<p>We then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?</p>\n\n<p>Finally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012.

I liked it because it exposed me to aspects and applications of Big Data that I hadn’t thought of.” - <em>Brian Greiner</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The big and “brave new world” of Big Data is going to change our world so much and in relatively short time. It’s literally and metaphorically breath talking in it”s scope and delivery! This course has given me a great taster of what’s happening right now with Data collection, how [Big Data] is changing and shaping our lives and the lives of our children, and what “ possibly” might be just around the corner.” - <em>Charles J McEleavy</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It was an interesting course addressing some key aspects of this area and opening my eyes both to the possibilities and the dangers. The studies going on and the spreading of this knowledge, making people more aware is, in my opinion, a great protection against the potential dangers. A well informed population will be more prepared to handle these issues.” - <em>Paula Santos</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Online & Digital"],"educator":"Suzy Moat and Tobias Preis (Lead Educators)","organisation":{"url":"http://www2.warwick.ac.uk","name":"The University of Warwick","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/64/20/6420e962-128b-482c-90cb-4eee9881dd0e.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2705064/video","runs":[{"uuid":"b062ab63-da55-48fe-9159-19a55e6b5074","start_date":"2015-04-20","duration_in_weeks":9},{"uuid":"64bd2c4b-d225-44cb-8406-7699c3e12a9a","start_date":"2016-03-07","duration_in_weeks":9}]},{"uuid":"b2432b8b-c33e-44b5-981c-9eb2cb90bfa7","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/climate-from-space?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/a4/e7/regular_a4e7190e-bd62-49db-a067-c447a53b8709.jpg","name":"Monitoring Climate from Space","introduction":"Explore our planet from space and learn how Earth observation is used to monitor climate change, with this free online course.","description":"<p>Satellite Earth Observation technology provides a powerful and compelling insight into climate change which can help to underpin climate policy, scientific research and public engagement.

According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.</p>\n\n<p>Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will have acquired the knowledge and analytical skills to develop critical insights into one of the most urgent issues of today’s world: the various roles of religion in conflicts.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Kim, Erin and Marjo (Lead educators) University of Groningen","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/3022180/video","runs":[{"uuid":"c9829757-f332-4f72-9d8e-b62131d58ae3","start_date":"2015-04-13","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"123acfa1-1a4e-47ee-a45d-f280e901f1e6","start_date":"2015-10-05","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"9c55be88-7d1e-4337-99f7-36413e88359a","start_date":"2016-03-07","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"569c1f99-ab83-4376-b85e-880f0b3a21f2","start_date":"2016-10-03","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"122a6ff1-64f7-4064-8aae-f273f18985f6","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/managing-my-investments?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/bc/02/regular_bc025666-072c-4378-9cf1-3bab52b6d7dc.jpg","name":"Managing My Investments","introduction":"Gain the skills to manage your investments: analyse portfolio risk and plan your pension, with this free online course.","description":"<p>Research shows that UK households are poor at investment management with a limited understanding of investment choices, risks and returns.

What Hans Christian Andersen did with this genre is absolutely unique - there are no other writers of fairy tales like him.</p>\n\n<p>Through the course, you will understand how Hans Christian Andersen’s authorship developed. From the rewriting of old folk tales via self-invented fairy tales to his so-called new fairy tales characterized by a modern approach.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-hans-christian-andersens-enduring-universal-appeal\">Explore Hans Christian Andersen’s enduring, universal appeal</h3>\n\n<p>Hans Christian Andersen often described himself as a “bog plant” – his roots were figuratively speaking deeply anchored in mire and mud, his very humble beginnings, but he constantly stretched up for the light of the sun, ie. for acceptance and recognition as an artist and a writer. And in fact he  grew from these humble beginnings to achieve fame and acknowledgement as an artist in both Europe and America while he was still alive. After his death, he has also become famous in Asia and all other parts of the world.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of Hans Christian Andersen’s around 200 fairy tales have been translated into at least 150 languages. They not only create a fantasy world for children, but also explore universal, sinister and more adult themes such as death, grief and loss.</p>\n\n<p>Through this course, you will discover why his stories have such an enduring and universal appeal - for both children and adults.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Literature"],"educator":"Jacob Bøggild","organisation":{"url":"http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/index_e.html","name":"Hans Christian Andersen Centre","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e2/91/e291c02c-5653-45c4-aeaf-f216fefc6276.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/4397780/video","runs":[{"uuid":"64e2e959-2a12-40c1-acce-c569fbf4667b","start_date":"2015-10-19","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"6bdeac33-f1a8-4f09-90e2-5448247238b1","start_date":"2016-04-18","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"f6a43e88-3ab9-47f4-87b6-ed0f631ffc41","start_date":"2016-10-24","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"037969b6-1a03-4ce8-bed6-52bfe19b1099","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/causes-of-climate-change?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/a1/84/regular_a184ac4b-f773-4ba7-87bb-fb9a23b1792c.jpg","name":"Causes of Climate Change","introduction":"Understand the physical processes behind climate variations in the past, present and future, with this free online course","description":"<p>This free online course provides the basis for understanding the underlying physical processes governing climate variations in the past, present and future.</p>\n\n<p>In the course, we focus on explaining the main external forcing mechanisms such as the sun, volcanoes, and changes in greenhouse gasses and aerosols, which can contribute to changing the global energy budget and initiate climate variations.</p>\n\n<p>We also describe the important role of internal feedback mechanisms and the energy transport in the atmosphere and ocean, in order to understand regional variations in climate.</p>\n\n<p>Through this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the complexities of the climate system, and be able to put the recently observed, man-made changes in climate in the context of past natural changes.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn with experts from The University of Bergen, which has a strong focus on Earth and Marine Sciences.

They are instruments of communication and are often a source of dignity and of human pride. Our life experiences and views of the world are bound up in our languages. Our sense of self might be strengthened by our ability to speak the language we choose or curtailed by our inability to understand the language that speaks to us. Some scholars even say that the right to speak one’s languages should be established as an essential part of the right to be oneself. They suggest that this language right should be honoured in all forms of communication.</p>\n\n<p>In this course, you will explore how people’s language practice, and the personal connection people have to the language(s) they speak, provoke important philosophical and pedagogical questions around the ways we form personal relationships, engage in business relations and even view the world around us.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-how-languages-challenge-the-way-we-live\">Explore how languages challenge the way we live</h3>\n\n<p>English is the language of worldwide communication.

How can we know which, if any, proposed policy options will work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. The new, interdisciplinary approach:</strong> we will explore how the science of complex social, economic, political, biological, physical and environmental systems can inform policy makers in their work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Data science and computational modelling for policy makers:</strong> we will look at so-called “policy informatics” – the new, policy-oriented methods of modelling complex systems on computers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Citizen engagement:</strong> a central concept of GSS is that the behaviour of social systems emerges bottom-up, from the interactions of individuals and institutions, in the context of top-down policy constraints. We will explore what this means in practice – why individual citizens must be involved in decision making and policy formulation.</p>\n\n<p>Because no method can provide perfect knowledge of the outcomes of policy, we will end with a critical evaluation of Global Systems Science, helping you understand its capabilities, limitations and future development.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World","Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Jeffrey Johnson","organisation":{"url":"http://cs-dc.org/","name":"UNESCO UNITWIN Complex Systems Digital Campus","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e0/a4/e0a4af34-8c9d-4d32-8737-f19fd24525d8.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/6650889/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f9df4c95-5e5f-4f65-9944-cb41faefa314","start_date":"2016-03-14","duration_in_weeks":2},{"uuid":"bacfbd8a-58c4-4647-a182-563787eff98e","start_date":"2016-06-06","duration_in_weeks":2},{"uuid":"41e73725-5543-43a3-bbe4-a90ef2d424d6","start_date":"2016-09-05","duration_in_weeks":2},{"uuid":"3aa83f54-ea2f-4617-9bc9-374f7c54cfb7","start_date":"2016-12-05","duration_in_weeks":2}]},{"uuid":"ab67861e-3a9f-4ebd-97d2-d8256e3a0b81","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/exploring-possible-futures?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/db/54/regular_db545c7a-45a5-4b94-af1c-be78e2c85027.jpg","name":"Exploring Possible Futures: Modeling in Environmental and Energy Economics","introduction":"Look to the future, learning how to develop and use models in environmental and energy economics, with this free online course.\r\n","description":"<p>What will efficient cities look like in future?

But occasionally, these feelings can develop into more long-lasting mental health difficulties, including anxiety and depression. Around a quarter of the population are directly affected each year by mental health difficulties where more specialist help and support is needed. This course offers an insight into two of the most commonly diagnosed mental health difficulties: anxiety and depression.</p>\n\n<p>This five week course will improve your understanding and knowledge around depression and anxiety, dispel some common myths about these disorders, and introduce you to a leading, effective treatment for both disorders, called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (or ‘CBT’ for short).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understanding-depression-and-anxiety\">Understanding depression and anxiety</h3>\n\n<p>Getting to grips with depression and anxiety is a learning journey.  In order to fully understand these difficulties we first need to understand how we process and make sense of the world around us, and how our emotional state may play an active role in this process. During the first week, we will explore this in more detail and there will be opportunities to consolidate your learning with a number of relevant practical activities.</p>\n\n<p>We will then look at depression and anxiety in turn, and will consider: how these disorders differ from ‘normal’ emotional states, highlight associated signs and symptoms, and explore some of the factors which may be responsible for maintaining these difficulties using a cognitive behavioural framework.</p>\n\n<p>The final two weeks will be devoted to illustrating how CBT can be used to treat depression and anxiety.\nEach week you’ll have the opportunity to engage in activities to help you apply the knowledge you gain on the course. There will be information to download, and interviews with experts and patients to help you understand more about these common disorders and one of the ways in which they can be successfully treated.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to emphasise that this online course is not intended to be a self-help ‘treatment’ for anyone experiencing anxiety or depression, nor can the information within it be used to formally ‘diagnose’ yourself or anyone else displaying symptoms of anxiety or depression. If you are concerned about yourself or someone else, you should in the first instance consult your primary healthcare professional.

Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You’ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also look at the structure of the virus in more detail, seeing how the study of influenza is now carried out at the molecular level.</p>\n\n<p>As well as mini-lectures, there will be laboratory demonstrations, interviews with experts in a variety of relevant fields, and discussion sessions, where you’ll be invited to contribute your own experiences and opinions to the subject of flu, and how we should treat and prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more in Dr Derek Gatherer’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/do-i-have-the-flu/\">Do I have the flu?

This fact places a considerable ethical weight on military practitioners as well as the civilian decision-makers who authorize military missions.</p>\n\n<p>The military profession is also unique in having a dedicated ethical framework associated with it, Just War Theory. This defines the conditions for when it is justified for a party to resort to war, the requirements for ethical conduct within the bounds of a war or armed conflict, and the conditions for a just ending to war.</p>\n\n<p>The ethical challenges that military professionals face do not, however, begin and end with the use of force. As such this course combines an overview of Just War Theory with an introduction to key principles of ethics that can aid military professionals in facing every day ethical challenges.</p>\n\n<p>Over seven weeks, we will explore six topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Foundations in ethical theory</li>\n<li>Ethics within the military profession</li>\n<li>Going to war</li>\n<li>The conduct of war</li>\n<li>Military and society</li>\n<li>Ethics, technology and war</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Specific topics addressed include role morality, illegal orders and whistleblowing, the competing duties of military commanders and the ethical challenges arising from new technologies such as unmanned and autonomous weapons systems, non-lethal weapons, and cyberwarfare.</p>\n\n<p>Leading military ethicist Deane-Peter Baker travels around the world exploring key issues and case studies and speaking with international ethicists, military professionals, historians, philosophers, government and NGO personnel to build a comprehensive introduction to this essential field.

Throughout, we will focus on the experiences of soldiers in the British, French, German and American armies, as these formed the majority of soldiers on the Western Front. This includes soldiers from the British and French empires, including Australian, Canadian, Indian, New Zealand, Algerian, Moroccan and West African soldiers.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn with John Connor, one of Australia’s leading military historians, and a team of international historians.

In the four weeks of this course we’ll investigate four forms of dementia that are important to understand better in their own right (they’re often not well recognised), but can also provide important insights that change how we think about dementia in general.  We will also make the point that dementia affects younger people too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 1 – What if dementia runs in the family?</strong><br>\nExplore the challenges that face families - and ground-breaking research taking place - with people affected by <strong>familial Alzheimer’s disease</strong>, where the condition runs in the family and often starts at a young age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 2 – What if dementia affects behaviour and personality?</strong><br>\nDementia is not just about memory loss – we investigate the particular challenges for diagnosis and care for people with <strong>behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 3 – What if dementia makes you see things that aren’t there?</strong><br>\nSome people with dementia experience hallucinations, and many describe fluctuations in their symptoms over time. These aspects are particularly clear in <strong>dementia with Lewy bodies</strong>, which you’ll learn about in Week 3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 4 – What if dementia affects your vision, not your memory?</strong> \nPeople with <strong>posterior cortical atrophy</strong> experience changes in the way the brain processes visual information; we’ll explore this condition and the research taking place to help people live better with visual impairment related to dementia.</p>\n\n<p><em>“The combination of personal stories paralleled by information given by expert clinicians and researchers was very engaging and, coupled with a multitude of interesting comments from course participants, provided a very well-rounded insight into the realities of dementia.” Anne Brink, learner in March 2016</em></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"learn-from-dementia-experts-experts-by-experience-and-each-other\">Learn from dementia experts, experts by experience and each other</h4>\n<p>This course is presented by experts from the UCL Institute of Neurology and Division of Psychiatry who are highly regarded for their work as scientists and clinicians. Importantly, you’ll hear from people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and people who care for a family member with dementia to get a better understanding of the impact that a diagnosis of dementia brings.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be able to understand how dementia affects people by watching video interviews, look deeper into the topics by reading articles, interact through activities and questions, and also learn from others on the course by taking part in the discussions that accompany each step.

But familiarity with Western philosophy doesn’t always mean an accurate understanding of its Asian counterpart.</p>\n\n<p>So what does the “Asian counterpart” of Western philosophy actually refer to? Confucianism? Daoism? Different schools of Buddhism like Theravada Buddhism or Mahayana Buddhism? And how do we understand each of them? This course will help you answer some of these questions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-an-easy-introduction-to-east-asian-philosophy\">Get an easy introduction to East Asian philosophy</h2>\n\n<p>Although English material on Asian perspectives can be easily found in the West, readers are often immediately frustrated by difficult terminology borrowed from classical Chinese/Sanskrit, along with the lack of explicit argument. So - is there any shortcut for accessing Asian philosophy without the burden of studying sinology or Indology? The answer is: yes. Contemporary Japanese philosophy offers such a shortcut.</p>\n\n<p>Compared with Chinese philosophy, Japanese philosophical texts are more analytically organised, allowing for them to be more easily interpreted in terms of Anglophone philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>In fact contemporary Japanese philosophers like Nishida Kitarō, Kuki Shuzō and Wastuji Tetsurō systematically introduced Western philosophical terminologies into their own theoretical work, so their works are more readable for a Western audience than classical Asian texts like The Book of Change.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understand-japanese-philosophical-problems\">Understand Japanese philosophical problems</h2>\n\n<p>This course is designed to help a largely Western audience explore philosophical problems through a Japanese lens, without needing to know Japanese or any Japanese philosophers. Throughout the course you’ll will become acquainted with the Japanese way of doing philosophy and you’ll unpack Asian ways of thinking.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the philosophical problems addressed in this course are actually widely discussed in the Western tradition of philosophy, so a basic sense of what Western philosophy is can be useful as these are problems that are often re-introduced in the context of Japanese culture.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, this course will also offer you a chance to re-evaluate your own philosophical assumptions by comparing them with their Japanese counterparts. Using these comparisons you’ll widen your own theoretical horizon when considering fundamental problems in philosophy.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-an-insight-into-asian-culture\">Get an insight into Asian Culture</h2>\n\n<p>Japanese culture is, by its nature, a hybrid of nearly all Asian cultures outside Japan. \nThis means the study of Japanese culture in some ways offers a ‘package solution’ to the study of Asian culture in a more general sense.

Deze cursus gaat in op de vraag wat recht is en waar je het kunt vinden.\r\n","description":"<p>Het recht regelt vrijwel alle aspecten van de maatschappij. Soms is dat heel zichtbaar: je komt het tegen in de rechtszaal bij een zaak tegen een grote crimineel of in de Tweede Kamer bij een verhit debat over een nieuw wetsvoorstel. Het recht regelt ook kleinere - maar belangrijke - dingen, zoals het huurcontract van je nieuwe woning of je arbeidsovereenkomst.</p>\n\n<p>Het recht is daarnaast voor een groot deel ‘onzichtbaar’. Als je bijvoorbeeld de dagelijkse boodschappen afrekent bij de kassa, ben je jezelf er wellicht niet direct van bewust dat er steeds een wederkerige verbintenisscheppende overeenkomst tot stand komt tussen jou en de supermarkt. Daaruit vloeien veel meer rechten en plichten voort dan alleen het leveren van de boodschappen en het betalen daarvoor.</p>\n\n<p>Juist omdat het recht zo veel invloed heeft op het leven van alledag, komt enige juridische kennis steeds van pas.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ben je in het recht geïnteresseerd, bijvoorbeeld omdat je daarmee in je werk- of privéomgeving regelmatig in aanraking komt?</li>\n  <li>Ben je op zoek naar de juiste studie, of wil je binnen je eigen studie je horizon verbreden?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dan is deze introducerende cursus interessant voor jou!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-tijdens-deze-cursus-gaat-doen\">Wat je tijdens deze cursus gaat doen</h3>\n<p>Door middel van video’s, artikelen, oefenvragen en discussies maak je de komende vijf weken jouw eerste stappen in de wereld van het recht.</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>eerste week</strong> legt de basis waarop we de rest van de weken voortbouwen. Wat is recht? Waar kun je het vinden? Hoe kun je het vinden? Je gaat zelf wetten en rechterlijke uitspraken opzoeken, lezen en gebruiken om je argumenten bij een juridische zaak goed te onderbouwen. Deze vaardigheden komen niet alleen gedurende deze cursus van pas, maar ook al direct in het dagelijks leven!</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>tweede week</strong> gaat over een heel zichtbaar deel van het recht: het staatsrecht. Wie maakt de regels? Hoe verhoudt de Tweede Kamer zich tot de regering? Je gaat op ontdekkingsreis in de Grondwet en leert wat de uitwerking is van grondrechten. Is het ene grondrecht belangrijker dan het andere? Betekent de vrijheid van meningsuiting dat je alles mag zeggen? En zijn er mensen die méér mogen zeggen dan anderen?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>derde week</strong> leer je meer over schade en aansprakelijkheid. Waarom kun je beter niet zomaar een kelderluik in een café open laten staan? En waarom moet je soms toch iemands schade vergoeden terwijl het niet jouw schuld was? En – ook belangrijk – wanneer hoeft dat niet?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>vierde week</strong> leer je wanneer en hoe je jezelf kunt verweren tegen de machtige overheid. Hoe ziet ‘het bestuur’ van ons land er precies uit? En wat kun je doen als je van de burgemeester geen project X-feestje mag houden? Of als je geen bouwvergunning voor een nieuwe dakkapel krijgt?</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>vijfde week</strong> gaat over een onderdeel van het recht waar je waarschijnlijk meteen aan denkt bij het woord ‘recht’: het strafrecht. Er komen vragen aan de orde als: wanneer bega je een strafbaar feit? Kun je de staf ontlopen door een ‘vormfout’? Wanneer en hoe intensief mag je jezelf of een ander verdedigen tegen een aanval?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-na-deze-cursus-kunt\">Wat je na deze cursus kunt</h3>\n<p>Na afloop van de cursus ben je in staat om:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>uit te leggen wat ‘recht’ is aan de hand van de functies, de bronnen en de indeling van het recht;</li>\n  <li>verschillende rechtsgebieden van elkaar te onderscheiden;</li>\n  <li>enkele juridische basisbegrippen te herkennen en te beschrijven;</li>\n  <li>wetgeving en uitspraken van rechters op te zoeken en op elementair niveau te analyseren;</li>\n  <li>basale juridische problemen op te lossen en de oplossing te motiveren aan de hand van wetsartikelen en rechterlijke uitspraken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Schrijf je nu in en doe mee!</strong></p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Law"],"educator":"Adriaan Wierenga","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8118661/video","runs":[{"uuid":"dcd2dac1-8fa9-49ea-8e7e-cacf3c34d772","start_date":"2016-05-30","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"7be445d6-0eb7-4607-affd-b4e06bc7ee79","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":5}]},{"uuid":"f7a1bf5d-55e6-4d00-9af8-b52ba1290952","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/macondo-es-gabriel-garcia-marquez?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e9/99/regular_e999c3c4-5a72-4d0d-8733-4dbf181306f8.jpg","name":"Leer a Macondo: La obra de Gabriel García Márquez","introduction":"Explorar por qué el autor de Cien años de Soledad es uno de los escritores más importantes del siglo XX.","description":"<h2 id=\"bienvenidos-al-curso-leer-a-macondo\">¡Bienvenidos al curso Leer a Macondo!</h2>\n\n<p>Gabriel García Márquez es un escritor colombiano que ganó el premio Nobel de Literatura en 1982 y ha sido reconocido como uno de los escritores más importantes del siglo XX.

We’ll also discuss how research underway at Newcastle University addresses these topics.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Privacy online:</strong>  What is privacy? We begin by looking into our own beliefs and practices when it comes to giving out our data online. What is the value of our personal data to businesses? And how can you find out what information about you is readily available online?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Payment safety:</strong> We make payments everyday, we purchase items at the store and we purchase items online, but how secure are these payments?  How safe is our money?   All of the different methods of payment cash, credit/debit card, cheque and bitcoin are a trade-off between security and convenience.   We will look at constantly evolving race between the payment fraud and the security measures employed to prevent fraud.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Security at home:</strong> With increasing numbers of autonomous, internet-enabled devices in our homes and cars, on our wrists and in our clothes, how could they be misused?

Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a ‘boiling point.’ Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States’  “rebalance” toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-regional-cooperation-and-economy\">Explore regional cooperation and economy</h2>\n<p>From a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China’s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor — the United States.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contemplate-the-future-of-south-korea\">Contemplate the future of South Korea</h2>\n<p>South Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea’s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific.

Understanding who is important to an organisation – and that’s everybody who has a stake in it in some way – is a really good starting point. Building relationships with interested groups and people is time well spent. So too is time spent on planning. As someone once said ‘To fail to plan is to plan to fail’. If there’s no plan, how do organisations get people on board? If there’s no plan, what’s the difference between success and failure?  How do you know when things are going off track? Or going well?</p>\n\n<p>Plans are one thing. The people who can make the plans a reality are those with the right knowledge, skills and experience. Without the right person, performing as well as they can in the right job, plans don’t get off the ground. So building, supporting, growing and developing a team is much of what leading and managing is all about.   And sometimes that’s about tackling poor performance, which can be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"develop-a-business-plan-and-build-an-effective-team\">Develop a business plan and build an effective team</h3>\n\n<p>This four-week course will guide you through the some key aspects of leadership and management.

In doing this we learn about the impact of inflation and taxation on incomes and the support to households provided by the state benefit system.</p>\n\n<p>In examining expenditure we look at the pressures placed on us to spend our money, how to shop with confidence on the internet and on how ‘heuristics’ can interfere with good spending decision-making.</p>\n\n<p>The course finishes by looking at a key area of household spending: insurance.

Today’s big data forecasting can include forecasting many series on a frequent basis, such as daily demand of thousands of products at retail chains, hourly statistics of wind turbines, minute-by-minute web traffic, and call volume to call centers.</p>\n\n<p>Forecasting can also be combined with statistical monitoring methods for purposes of anomaly detection – for example, public health organizations collect and monitor clinical and other data for detecting disease outbreaks. Forecasting is also often combined with simulation for purposes of scenario building. On this course we’ll have a look at some of these uses in more depth as well as examining the processes that these different industries use.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understand-the-forecasting-process\">Understand the forecasting process</h2>\n<p>This course focuses on forecasting time series, where past and present values are used to forecast future values of a series of interest.

On this course, you will consider some of the key issues related to the ethical dimensions implied by climate change – learning especially from the problems faced as well as the resilience models formulated by the marginalized sectors of society or the so-called “Global South”.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understand-the-environmental-problems-and-proposed-solutions-by-the-global-south\">Understand the environmental problems and proposed solutions by the Global South</h2>\n\n<p>Although the populations of the Global South have least contributed to the greenhouse gas emissions that have exacerbated the negative effects of climate change, they are also the ones who are most vulnerable to extreme weather conditions such as droughts, floods, typhoons, sea-level rise and desertification. Needless to say, these phenomena have profound social implications that may harm future generations.</p>\n\n<p>This situation raises some major ethical questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>To what extent are human beings entitled to exploit nature for their needs and interests?</li>\n  <li>Who is to be held responsible, or what kind of shared responsibility is appropriate in addressing climate change?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The effects of climate change disasters, however, are not only confined to the global south but are also felt by the more affluent sectors of societies or the Global North.</p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve a more sustainable world where nature can continue to support the aspirations for better living conditions for future and disadvantaged generations, a notion of justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature and the human beings’ rights to live and enjoy the fruits of their labor must be formulated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-about-climate-justice\">Learn about climate justice</h2>\n\n<p>Following the recommendation of UNESCO’s World Commission for the Ethics of Science and Technology (COMEST) in the promotion of Biological and Cultural Diversity as starting point of Climate Change Ethics, UNESCO is currently pioneering a worldwide reflection on the ‘ethical principles in relation to climate change’. Along the same line, within its philosophy programme, in 2014 UNESCO published the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002284/228411E.pdf\">“Manual of Philosophy – A South-South Perspective”</a>. This Manual sheds a new light on the singularity of some major philosophical texts and traditions from the Global South.</p>\n\n<p>This course has been built upon these two major undertakings. It will propose a notion of climate justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature, on the one hand, while supporting the biological and economic needs of human populations, on the other hand.  Human needs and ecological integrity, therefore, need not be opposing but more supportive of one another in so far as human beings allow nature to regenerate herself by regulating their excessive consumption of natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>The course proposes groundbreaking reflections on Climate Justice, from the philosophical and ethical points of view, while exploring the Global South’s approaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-how-humans-can-balance-their-needs-with-the-needs-of-the-planet\">Explore how humans can balance their needs with the needs of the planet</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you’ll learn about the various practices of frugality in the global south and enable you to adapt these practices to your own circumstances in view of contributing to the needs of the most vulnerable populations of society.</p>\n\n<p>You will also be able to imagine different ways of extracting natural resources without compromising the regenerating capacity of nature to sustain itself and thus continuously support the needs of all human beings.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment","Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Rainier Ibana","organisation":{"url":"http://en.unesco.org/","name":"UNESCO","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/21/0e/210e513f-d31a-4ae0-b47d-32092897bf56.png"},"runs":[{"uuid":"f459df50-d603-4186-9130-cafdb9060f35","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"80b46e3a-fece-46a5-8105-2e3dd5e1ca57","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/european-culture?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/7f/6c/regular_7f6cbd08-46c5-447f-8069-4286928bd5ec.jpg","name":"European Culture and Politics","introduction":"Learn about the link between identity, culture and politics in the construction of contemporary Europe. \r\n","description":"<p>This free online course explains what Europe is, not as a geographically demarcated territory, but as a cultural and political product.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-european-culture-and-politics--and-todays-key-challenges\">Explore European culture and politics – and today’s key challenges</h3>\n\n<p>The course is a collaborative work of a multidisciplinary team from the University of Groningen, in partnership with the Universities of Göttingen, Krakow and Uppsala. We will revisit and tackle the perceived “truths” about the meaning of European identity and Europeanness. We will examine the ways in which cultural knowledge and facts were constructed to further integration processes in post-World War II Europe.</p>\n\n<p>You will analyse and explain the intertwined relationship between culture and politics in constructing and governing contemporary Europe. You will gain deep understanding of how struggles over the meaning of Europe have shaped European contemporary society and how they will shape Europe’s future.

You will learn how European culture is imagined and constructed by European institutions via the EU’s language policy or the Capital of Culture programme, but also how these top-down interventions into the meaning of Europe are challenged by local/grass-root cultural practices and interventions.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>second week</strong>, you will look at the role religion plays in European politics and societies. You will revisit the role of religion in European public spheres and you will critically examine secularisation and the idea of a secular Europe.You will see if Europe can be identified through a particular religion (or absence of religion). And you will see how religion has been used to identify what is Europe and what is not Europe</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>third week</strong> considers Europe’s relationship with modernity. Europe is often held as a standard: it is where modern science developed, where modern political systems came into being and where modern literary genres were invented. You will look at the assumptions behind and implications of this idea of modernity.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>fourth week</strong>, we turn to the nation-state. Although the EU is often said to be the anti-thesis of the nation-state, some have argued that it has actually saved it. You will examine the EU as an unique experiment in the creation of a post-national political entity. You will also be asked to rethink the existing forms of political organisation in Europe and propose sustainable solutions for problems linked to integration beyond the nation state.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>fifth week</strong> examines how Europe is constructed as a democratic space. You will see how European political integration has been furthered and legitimised through a particular reading of democracy. Focus is placed on challenges and possible solutions to the construction of democracy in a post-national society.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>sixth week</strong> you will examine how European identity is constructed via practices of othering; claims of what Europe is not. By addressing the question of Europe’s other we will not only gain a better perspective on how Europe is imagined but also whose voices remain silent/marginalised in this process. If we want to build a more inclusive Europe – and we do – critical questions of who is Europe’s other and how is Europe imagined by this other – need to be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>describe how European political integration is embedded in broader cultural modalities such as language or memory;</li>\n<li>explain Europe as a multifaceted and ever-changing entity;</li>\n<li>define the main transdisciplinary debates on Europe and European identity;</li>\n<li>understand deeper and more underlying roots of contemporary problems of Europe integration;\n</li><li>propose innovative sustainable solutions to these problems;</li>\n<li>debate sensitive topics in a culturally and academically diverse environment. </li>\n\n</ul>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World","Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Senka Neuman","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7464372/video","runs":[{"uuid":"48fb1a89-41f0-4469-8e91-34ef3add2a36","start_date":"2016-09-26","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"cd299146-3a1a-45f1-a5c3-0e12f788de0a","url":"http://www.futurelearn.com/courses/medical-humanity?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ca/fa/regular_cafa032e-cce6-4658-9f49-ab408bc34bb3.jpg","name":"Medical Humanity: Engaging Patients and Communities in Healthcare ","introduction":"Find out how and why you should engage patients and communities in the development of new healthcare technology and treatments.","description":"<p>The development of healthcare treatments has given people hope to fight diseases.
