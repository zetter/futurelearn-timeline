This course will help you to understand how programs work and guide you through creating your own computer program – a mobile game.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re a complete newcomer to programming, or have some basic skills, this course provides a challenging but fun way to start programming in Java. Over seven weeks we will introduce the basic constructs that are used in many programming languages and help you to put this knowledge into practice by changing the game code we have provided. You’ll have the freedom to create a game that’s unique to you, with support from the community and educators if you get stuck. You’ll learn how to create algorithms to solve problems and translate these into code, using the same tools as industry professionals worldwide. We will be using Google’s Android Studio as the platform for programming.</p>\n\n<p>The course will combine video introductions, on-screen examples, downloadable guides, articles and discussions to help you understand the principles behind computer programs and the building blocks that are used to create them. Multiple choice quizzes will help you to check your understanding, while exercises each week will show you how to use your new skills to improve your game.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you’ll have a complete game that can be played on an Android phone or tablet, or even your computer.

The course content includes a variety of videos, articles, discussions and assignments.</p>\n\n<p>The course provides a taster of the subject and we hope the topics we have chosen give you an overview of this fascinating area. For those requiring further depth, we’ll be providing external links and additional resources each week.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment","Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Jon Copley","organisation":{"url":"http://www.southampton.ac.uk/","name":"University of Southampton","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/39/f4/39f4849a-d4a6-4bfd-a7c9-832fa5c83a4e.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/1545435/video","runs":[{"uuid":"c867504e-e4ed-4a2b-9a99-64d517496064","start_date":"2014-02-03","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"99af4683-a23b-403a-b953-d4ecbe9f588e","start_date":"2014-10-27","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"c712e061-0130-4f4e-99ef-c9cdd9b753cc","start_date":"2015-08-31","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"4da29a85-9b2e-427d-9f33-9dc07308c382","start_date":"2016-10-10","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"da22d833-3f64-4ff6-809f-3185f8975667","start_date":"2017-01-23","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"baab3813-31a9-4e25-9d97-21ecffca2f97","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/good-brain-bad-brain-basics?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/69/6c/regular_696ca98e-c62a-4be3-8654-adb47abb2167.jpg","name":"Good Brain, Bad Brain: Basics","introduction":"What do we know and what are we discovering about the form and function of the human brain?

So how should we, as healthcare professionals, respond? As medicines are key to the successful management of chronic conditions, underuse or non-adherence represents a lost opportunity for the health improvement for the patient as well as being a waste of valuable resources for healthcare systems. In Europe alone, the cost of poor adherence to treatment is estimated at 195,000 lives and €20 billion annually.</p>\n\n<p>This two week course is designed for pharmacists, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals with a role or interest in supporting patients with long-term conditions. We’ve invited a range of inspirational healthcare professionals, researchers and clinical academics from across King’s College London’s Institute of Pharmaceutical Science and the Pharmaceutical Clinical Academic Group at King’s Health Partners to contribute to this course. You will be able to immerse yourself in our engaging video material, scenarios and discussions to explore the challenges of medicines non-adherence, factors that may influence patient medicines use and approaches that can be used to effectively engage patients in patient-centred consultations about self-managing medicines.</p>\n\n<p>Delivered in bite-sized sections, you will be able to enhance your own understanding of medicines adherence and, importantly, gain increasing awareness of where in your own day-to-day consultations you can apply these techniques and approaches to better support patient self-management of medicines. We look forward to walking you through this important and challenging area of healthcare provision.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of this two week course, learners will have developed their understanding, and reflected upon their own clinical practice and consultation skills, in order to:</p>\n\n<p>1) Identify patients who may be having problems with their medicines</p>\n\n<p>2) Employ strategies to support these patients with the use of their medicines.</p>\n\n<p>The learning materials have been designed to take approximately 1-2 hours per week to complete.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"success-and-feedback-from-the-course\">Success and feedback from the course</h2>\n\n<p>Since April 2014 over 15,000 learners have registered on this course from across the world.

Established by Claudius and enlarged by the emperor Trajan with spoils of the Dacian wars, the port was the conduit for everything the city of Rome required from its Mediterranean provinces: the food and, particularly grain, that fed the largest urban population of the ancient world, as well as luxuries of all kinds, building materials, people and wild animals for the arena.</p>\n\n<p>On this course you will chart a journey from the Imperial harbour to its connections across the Mediterranean, learning about what the archaeological discoveries uncovered by the Portus Project tell us about the history, landscape, buildings, and the people of this unique place. Although the site lies in ruins, it has some of the best-preserved Roman port buildings in the Mediterranean, and in this course you will learn to interpret these and the finds discovered within them, using primary research data and the virtual tools of the archaeologist.</p>\n\n<p>Largely filmed on location at Portus, the course will provide you with an insight into the wide range of digital technologies employed to record, analyse and present the site.

The relationship between these physical properties and the more subjective characteristics of music such as pitch, loudness, dynamic range and timbre is then examined.

People are increasingly bombarded by dramatic and at times disturbing headlines. Yet general knowledge of Muslims and their faith can be poor. There is consequently a need for a balanced and well-informed understanding of the current debates around this internationally significant topic.</p>\n\n<p>This course uses Britain as a case study to shed light on wider issues relating to the growth of Islamic communities across the culturally Christian and increasingly secularised Western World. This MOOC reflects the work of the Islam-UK Centre at Cardiff University, and the research that we have conducted over the last decade.  This means that we focus in this course upon the everyday lives of Muslims in Britain, as opposed to the activities of the very small minority of Muslims who engage in terrorist activities.  Later in the course, we will help you to access material on this topic if you are interested</p>\n\n<p>Topics include:</p>\n\n<p><em>Islamic Practice</em> An outline of Islamic practices and beliefs plus an introduction to the different viewpoints within Islam.</p>\n\n<p><em>History of Islam in Britain</em> An exploration of the longstanding associations between Islam and Britain, including Islamic influences on British society and the well-established connections between Britain and the countries from which many British Muslims originally hailed.</p>\n\n<p><em>Settlement Patterns</em> The origins and makeup of today’s British Muslim communities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Cultural Diversity</em> Confronting the ‘myth’ of a homogenous Muslim community through an exploration of the various religious and cultural influences that characterise and inform Muslim communities in Britain today.</p>\n\n<p><em>Contemporary Debates</em> An examination of how the above topics feed into the contemporary debates and what the future might hold.</p>\n\n<p>Given current debates about multiculturalism, integration, and the spectre of fundamentalism, this course will appeal to a wide audience not only in Britain but far beyond.</p>\n\n<p>The course will also include an exciting opportunity to join us live via web streaming for the IslamUK Centre’s Public Lecture Series each week as a series of leading scholars address key topics in depth.</p>\n\n<p>To find out more, read Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/muslims-in-britain-exploring-diversity-and-challenging-stereotypes/\">Muslims in Britain: exploring diversity and challenging stereotypes</a>.”</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Professor Sophie Gilliat-Ray","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/","name":"Cardiff University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/95/11/95118ca8-be03-43d0-b088-54dd1b16c014.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2296530/video","runs":[{"uuid":"0b4c9035-3187-4a9f-ad64-05717bd3dcba","start_date":"2014-03-10","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"41d70f04-b88b-4fca-ac7e-e241d2731ea2","start_date":"2015-02-09","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"930360fd-d77e-49c6-be63-37a12d129626","start_date":"2016-02-22","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"7082983f-6095-43f3-a491-c719f757a343","start_date":"2017-02-20","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"78f027e1-0a44-45ee-b54a-f5ebf3a5b5a2","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeares-hamlet?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e9/95/regular_e9953aa7-9c18-4279-8e84-6db2d24652e2.jpg","name":"Shakespeare's Hamlet: Text, Performance and Culture","introduction":"Experts from the Shakespeare Institute guide an exploration of the most famous play ever staged.","description":"<p>Hamlet is the most famous play ever written and the masterpiece of the most important writer in English, William Shakespeare.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.”<br>\nAgha Hasan Abedi</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation? As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other.</p>\n\n<p>So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together? The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them.</p>\n\n<p>We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in ten weeks but we can set you on the path.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>“Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet”<br>\nHenry Mintzberg</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\">Who is this course for?</h3>\n<p>The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial.</p>\n\n<p>The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-might-i-learn-and-how-might-this-benefit-me\">What might I learn and how might this benefit me?</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to manage people and get them engaged.</li>\n  <li>How to get the best out of people.</li>\n  <li>What good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection.</li>\n  <li>Tools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"what-will-the-learning-experience-be-like-and-what-will-be-expected-of-me\">What will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me?</h3>\n<p>The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience.</p>\n\n<p>You must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches. Indeed, sharing your experiences and reflections with others on the course will help you to get the most out of it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"delivered-by-the-henley-business-school\">Delivered by the Henley Business School</h3>\n<p>This course will be delivered by <a href=\"http://www.henley.ac.uk\">Henley Business School</a>, a triple accredited, world-renowned business school, part of the University of Reading.

Does our sense of the entire period change when we examine general social and cultural trends or when we investigate their effect on private lives?</p>\n\n<p>Join this course as we begin to consider these and other questions.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You can find out more about what to expect from this course in Ciarán Wallace’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/whats-going-to-happen-tomorrow\">Do you know what’s going to happen tomorrow?</a>”</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"Professor Ciaran Brady Dr. Anne Dolan Dr. Ciaran Wallace","organisation":{"url":"http://www.tcd.ie/","name":"Trinity College Dublin","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/42/de/42de74bd-de00-4a0e-b3f2-5dbbe95c819d.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2340437/video","runs":[{"uuid":"8c347932-02da-461f-b9de-67653a9e8840","start_date":"2014-09-01","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"f7351f4c-4524-48e6-ad8d-a2961076ffb4","start_date":"2015-03-16","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"427ccf97-4072-4431-8744-7a0e3dd2e141","start_date":"2016-03-14","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"54cdff15-e786-4ed7-9c76-17178ae7fdf4","start_date":"2016-10-31","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"9c55d79d-304b-4c8e-aceb-41fac228b0a6","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/good-brain-bad-brain-drugs?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/30/94/regular_3094e11c-a724-4785-8780-58eb71aed537.jpg","name":"Good Brain, Bad Brain: Drug Origins","introduction":"Explore our past, present and future understanding of drugs with this online course.

The Wall, complemented by a sophisticated system of outposts and coastal watch stations, offers a remarkable glimpse of ancient society. In addition to housing one of the largest concentrations of Roman soldiers anywhere in the Empire’s provinces, Hadrian’s frontier system was home to an incredibly cosmopolitan array of civilians.</p>\n\n<p>This six week course offers a comprehensive introduction to Hadrian’s Wall and its people and raises fascinating issues concerning colonisation, cultural transformation, immigration, integration and imperialism. We will explore life in the region before the construction of the Wall, the arrival of the Roman army and its impact on the local population. Detailed case studies will consider the different features of the Wall and its surroundings, considering the way in which the frontier system evolved throughout the Roman period. The changing face of both the Roman army and indigenous populations is richly illuminated through archaeological finds and reconstructions. To appreciate the range and character of native people, soldiers’ families, slaves, merchants and migrants, we will examine their homes, dress, diet, rituals and religious beliefs.</p>\n\n<p>Drawing on the very latest research, we will investigate how archaeologists interpret evidence, considering:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the factors that determine the survival of evidence</li>\n  <li>the different methods of archaeological prospection used to detect settlement locations and better understand their organisation</li>\n  <li>the planning of archaeological projects</li>\n  <li>excavation techniques</li>\n  <li>and the detailed study of structures and artefacts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As part of the course you can test your understanding of these methods with real case studies and participate in a series of archaeological experiments designed to help you appreciate the complexities of daily life on Rome’s most famous frontier.</p>\n\n<p>Find out more about new discoveries and how learners are helping to shape the content of these course runs on the <a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/how-learners-are-helping-shape-our-courses-about-hadrians-wall\">FutureLearn blog</a>.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"Ian Haynes","organisation":{"url":"http://www.ncl.ac.uk","name":"Newcastle University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e7/3a/e73a2f33-be3e-4e3f-9090-046353e05505.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/2317804/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f8ffa395-10ff-4d0f-b819-533e0f0d29ad","start_date":"2014-09-22","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"88d5a221-9dba-4f28-9209-c1de6d214f2e","start_date":"2015-06-15","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"932a1232-1b0c-4f92-9b7d-91fd29df9149","start_date":"2015-11-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"dc0e03ec-4d4f-4bf9-aa2c-e24f6e8c0a77","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"5a54bae0-e90e-45ce-bd2f-c5c3cff77d07","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mental-health-and-well-being?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/22/29/regular_2229c235-75ed-4f5d-b8da-90bc2f4c6506.jpg","name":"Psychology and Mental Health: Beyond Nature and Nurture","introduction":"Learn how a psychological understanding of our emotions and behaviour gives us new ways to improve mental health and well-being.","description":"<p>Psychological therapies and the work of clinical psychologists are now very popular.

Next, we cover a number of tools and methods to understand and be able to navigate through the complex and uncertain world.</p>\n\n<p>The need for a multidisciplinary approach will be emphasised throughout the course. Guest lecturers from different faculties will explain, provide applications and examples from their respective fields of study for a more comprehensive understanding of the different elements of complexity. For example, complexity can be beautifully explained by the use of insects and brains and many other natural and social phenomena. The same ideas can be applied to economic and financial systems.</p>\n\n<p>After introducing the first principles, guest lecturers will cover interdisciplinary aspects of complexity. These are graph theory and networks, emergent behaviour, agent-based modelling, evolutionary dynamics, cellular automata and self-organisation, complexity in history, decision making under uncertainty, heuristics and biases and subsequently entrepreneurship. Finally, relating this all back together in two case studies will conclude the course.

We’ll be taking in the history of play at the Museum of Childhood in London; discovering how everyday knowledge informs playfulness and imagination; visiting virtual worlds where the boundaries between fantasy and reality are blurred; exploring outdoor play spaces in towns, cities and parks; looking at how play spaces can be designed to encourage playfulness; and seeing what happens when players bend the rules.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also look at play as the subject of serious study by talking to academics across a range of Social Sciences  disciplines here at the University of Sheffield. We’ll discuss definitions of play and current debates about how the nature of play changes - does play help us to learn? Can it prepare young people to be successful in the adult world? How do we learn to subvert the rules? Are all forms of play good for us? We’ll also talk about the regular media panics about the presumed dangers of technology-related play, such as computer games.</p>\n\n<p>The knowledge that you gain from this course may inspire you to follow a career related to play, or in the creative industries; it may encourage you to be a more playful parent or carer, which is the foundation of bonding from the very first games of peek-a-boo; we may also persuade you that play is a fundamental part of innovation and creativity across a whole range of subjects, careers, disciplines and industries from fashion to engineering, from teaching to business.</p>\n\n<p>Through this course we hope to help you to think differently about play, and discover why something that is so often taken for granted is actually very important and significant to us all.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/future-of-play/\">Read more about this course</a> on the FutureLearn blog.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Health & Psychology","Sport & Leisure"],"educator":"Elizabeth Wood and  Jackie Marsh","organisation":{"url":"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/","name":"The University of Sheffield","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/69/38/6938de7c-7c38-4c9f-a6d0-e3610bcf7ae5.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/5053351/video","runs":[{"uuid":"b763b5b7-97ee-4a38-b198-b894a51a7def","start_date":"2014-09-29","duration_in_weeks":7},{"uuid":"52c870d7-64ce-4d8f-b651-2ee85edf06ee","start_date":"2015-10-19","duration_in_weeks":7}]},{"uuid":"5867c327-be6b-45f8-8d7e-e901104d2805","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/heart-health?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/d4/fb/regular_d4fbef68-f45c-4b02-a1f4-a69d2a49f599.jpg","name":"Heart Health: A Beginner's Guide to Cardiovascular Disease","introduction":"Learn more about how your heart works, the causes of heart disease and how to keep your heart healthy with this free online course","description":"<p>Your heart beats around 100,000 times a day, pumping blood around your body to deliver oxygen and nutrients, while taking away waste products.</p>\n\n<p>When your heart is unhealthy, it can’t perform this vital task so effectively.

You’ll get to hear the stories of the fascinating individuals who contributed to both its rise and fall.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, you’ll be able to debate the questions these themes raise with learners from around the world, and draw your own conclusions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-from-experts-in-imperial-history-and-develop-your-own-ideas-through-conversation\">Learn from experts in imperial history and develop your own ideas through conversation</h3>\n\n<p>This course has been created by experts from the <a href=\"http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/research/centres/imperialandglobal/\">Centre for Imperial and Global History</a> at the University of Exeter. The Centre brings together the strong research expertise of the University’s imperial historians. It comprises one of the largest groups of imperial and global historians currently working in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>The lead educator for this course is <a href=\"http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/history/staff/toye/\">Richard Toye</a> - Professor of Modern History and author of several acclaimed books, including “Churchill’s Empire: the World That Made Him and the World He Made.” Richard has provided a taste of this course in his post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/british-empire/\">Why is the British Empire still so controversial?</a>”</p>\n\n<p>Richard and his colleagues won’t be able to join the discussions themselves or respond to individual comments, but the course encourages a strong learning community. The learning is focussed around debate and discussion - supporting other learners, sharing your own experience and knowledge, and listening to new perspectives. We hope that you will enjoy interacting with and learning from each other in this way.</p>\n\n<p>You can start to explore the Empire and find out more about the Centre for Imperial and Global History on its blog, <a href=\"http://imperialglobalexeter.com/2013/11/18/welcome-to-the-imperial-global-forum/\">Imperial &amp; Global Forum</a>, or by following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExeterCIGH\">@ExeterCIGH</a> on Twitter.</p>\n\n<p>This course has been commended by the Royal Historical Society, as part of the Public History Prize 2015, in the Web and Digital Category.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["History"],"educator":"Richard Toye ","organisation":{"url":"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/","name":"University of Exeter","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ac/97/ac97d565-7c4a-443b-8fcf-93993d12e20b.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/4483092/video","runs":[{"uuid":"810f45ca-fcb8-4632-97ec-c383758b3f55","start_date":"2015-01-19","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"2c4a8917-1ba7-41f8-ab1e-a3f4f51277db","start_date":"2015-09-14","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"165210c4-a74d-49ec-ab9a-f0a4be326f49","start_date":"2015-11-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"90db11b1-776c-4bdc-8a3b-1de6cf3b367c","start_date":"2016-01-11","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"7ad86e7a-e461-4cdf-990b-54633a85a541","start_date":"2016-03-21","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"013132b4-d265-408c-8c18-f765050f85df","start_date":"2016-05-30","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"9c3463c8-80a5-4938-bcb1-b6e9d2685e87","start_date":"2016-08-08","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"442f74bd-775a-45b6-a496-c9824f89950d","start_date":"2016-10-17","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"63936660-3945-4636-964a-f85a3d515c23","start_date":"2017-01-16","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"c698e19a-9546-4d4b-b1b6-5d184085fd33","start_date":"2017-03-27","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"02c26530-d2af-48d7-a571-83a0d58e9bd3","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/agrifood?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/58/5f/regular_585f12a2-9455-4cf3-b969-3e04243a1934.jpg","name":"Tackling the Global Food Crisis: Sustainable Agrifood Systems","introduction":"This course looks at food insecurity and the challenges to be overcome in order to maintain healthy and sustainable food supplies.","description":"<p>This is the second course in a two-part series by Queen’s University Belfast looking at issues concerning the maintenance and enhancement of global food supplies, whilst improving human wellbeing in the developed and developing world.</p>\n\n<p>This course will focus on threats to global food security and the challenges that need to be overcome, in order to maintain healthy and sustainable food supplies.</p>\n\n<p>The course will begin by looking at global food insecurity and the potential consequences for human health.

Understand what shale gas is and why it divides opinion.","description":"<p>Shale gas is seen by many as a cheap, clean and plentiful source of energy; a low-carbon ‘game changer’ helping us meet the world’s rapidly growing demands for energy and offering greater energy security. Its rapid rise has not been without controversy, however. Earth tremors, surface and groundwater contamination, and the effects of fracking on human and animal health are all high profile concerns.</p>\n\n<p>During this four-week course, we’ll study the politics, economics, and science of shale gas. We’ll examine how shale gas was formed, and how we extract it through hydraulic fracturing, or ‘fracking’. We will look at the impact of shale gas on energy markets and energy security.</p>\n\n<p>We then move on to the environmental politics of shale. What are the local effects in terms of water contamination, seismic activity, and air pollution? What are the global effects? Does shale gas offer a ‘bridge’ to a low-carbon future, or would we be walking the plank?</p>\n\n<p>Finally we look at the question of what the public thinks, an area where the University of Nottingham has particular expertise, having run a public opinion survey on shale gas since 2012. Why are the US and UK experiences so different? What do the public think of allowing unconventional gas to be developed?</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the course you will have improved you understanding of the costs and benefits of shale gas, and you will have made your contribution to the public debate on this important topic.</p>\n\n<p>Keep up to date with announcements and discussions by following the course on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShaleGas_MOOC\">@ShaleGas_MOOC</a>.

They will present you a selection of their current research and will explain the fundamental questions they try to answer and the experimental approaches they use for their studies.</p>\n\n<p>You will learn that ageing starts at the cell level and you will study several phenomena which take place in cells, such as genomic instability, telomere shortening and epigenetic changes.</p>\n\n<p>By completing this course you will gain insight into the fundamental biology of ageing in various simple and complex organisms, including humans. This course will be particularly relevant for those who have a basic background in biology and want to know more about the biology of ageing.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Health & Psychology","Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Marianna Bevova","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/3155756/video","runs":[{"uuid":"07416aa1-2434-4f58-aeec-1d07db4c1853","start_date":"2015-06-01","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"e9f44b03-6c6d-426c-98c6-696a888f0f92","start_date":"2015-11-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"9a4f6cbb-4c4a-4758-b968-e677cc2deeba","start_date":"2016-05-02","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"d29593b3-8f39-403d-801b-649ddf27207e","start_date":"2017-01-16","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"718bc831-2279-4333-bc0e-167a5ceebcbc","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/religion-and-conflict?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/d7/ef/regular_d7ef63d4-5ee9-409f-9b5f-be27016bc9eb.jpg","name":"Religion and Conflict","introduction":"Understand and analyze the role of religion in conflicts and peacebuilding in present-day societies, with this free online course.","description":"<p>Many conflicts in the world today are framed in terms of religion, but there is much discussion and confusion concerning  the precise role religion plays in these conflicts. According to some,  conflict and violence are inherent to religion. Others claim that religion is only the guise under which social, economic or political conflicts are fought out. The first step to solving religiously framed conflicts is understanding the role of religion in them, and that is what this free online course is about.</p>\n\n<p>Our point of departure is that religion means different things in different circumstances and to different (groups of) people. Therefore, the aim of this course is to show how a religiously framed conflict can be studied in the wider cultural and political contexts of these conflicts. In the course material, we will refer to various religious, cultural and political settings. In addition, we invite you to engage in some modest research activities in your own environment and compare your own findings with those of fellow students.</p>\n\n<p>In the first two weeks, we will discuss how the concepts of religion, conflict and violence have been understood historically and cross-culturally, and address the question of how they are linked. This will enable you to move beyond thinking about religion as either an unavoidable cause for conflicts or merely an excuse to mask more mundane conflicts of interest.</p>\n\n<p>The third week focuses on the question of why religious conflicts have appeared to increase in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. During the fourth week, we will analyze case studies like conflicts over abortion policies in the United States and the rise of IS in the Middle East. In week five, we will shift our attention to the role of religion in peace building and reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>The course concludes with an assignment in which you will apply your newly acquired analytical tools to write a briefing paper on the role of religion in a specific conflict situation of your own choice.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will have acquired the knowledge and analytical skills to develop critical insights into one of the most urgent issues of today’s world: the various roles of religion in conflicts.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Kim, Erin and Marjo (Lead educators) University of Groningen","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/3022180/video","runs":[{"uuid":"c9829757-f332-4f72-9d8e-b62131d58ae3","start_date":"2015-04-13","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"123acfa1-1a4e-47ee-a45d-f280e901f1e6","start_date":"2015-10-05","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"9c55be88-7d1e-4337-99f7-36413e88359a","start_date":"2016-03-07","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"569c1f99-ab83-4376-b85e-880f0b3a21f2","start_date":"2016-10-03","duration_in_weeks":6},{"uuid":"0b7e19ee-ca77-40c0-be93-0814f580ed13","start_date":"2017-03-06","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"122a6ff1-64f7-4064-8aae-f273f18985f6","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/managing-my-investments?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/bc/02/regular_bc025666-072c-4378-9cf1-3bab52b6d7dc.jpg","name":"Managing My Investments","introduction":"Gain the skills to manage your investments: analyse portfolio risk and plan your pension, with this free online course.","description":"<p>Research shows that UK households are poor at investment management with a limited understanding of investment choices, risks and returns.

And can anyone get a robot to do a particular task?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"an-introduction-to-robotics\">An introduction to robotics</h3>\n\n<p>If you’d like to find out more, but are worried that you don’t have Hawking’s brain or an advanced qualification in cybernetics, this four week, free online course is for you.</p>\n\n<p>We’re not planning to sit you down with a soldering iron, but we will introduce you to the basics of robot design through a series of simulations that will have you test driving an Eric – our very own University of Reading mobile robot.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-far-back-does-robot-history-go\">How far back does Robot history go?</h3>\n\n<p>We’ll start by looking at some of the earliest, real and fictional robots ever invented: from musical automata in 13th century Iraq to Leonardo da Vinci’s mechanical lion; from the early 20th century science fiction of “Metropolis” and Asimov to the first Mars lander in 1996.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"look-inside-a-mobile-robot\">Look inside a mobile robot</h3>\n\n<p>After dipping into robot history, you’ll be ready to get more hands on. Our experts will guide you through the basics. Using a combination of videos, animations, screencasts, articles, discussions and quizzes, you’ll explore the internals of mobile robots.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll find out about the individual components of robot anatomy (the mechanics, electronics and computer “brain”) and how they relate to one another and to the sensors - the parts that enable the machine to perceive its surroundings.</p>\n\n<p>Next, you’ll tackle the motors: how do you control your robot to help it avoid obstacles, head in the right direction and travel at an optimum speed?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-thinking-machine\">A “thinking” machine?</h3>\n\n<p>In the final week, you’ll investigate the thought-provoking topic of robot behaviour.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>What can we learn about developing robots based on what we know about living systems?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>If we introduce a simple “brain”, what influence does this have on the robot’s behaviour?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>How is a robot’s movement specified by what it perceives?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Can we create robots with basic instincts, and the ability to learn and co-operate with one another?</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Come and join us for this action-packed course.

Can we ensure that these principles are implemented wisely?</p>\n\n<p>This free online course will look at risk management in its broadest terms, giving you the opportunity to evaluate the crucial role played by risk in the global economy, both in terms of its opportunities and its potential dangers.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-financial-investments-and-the-associated-risks\">Understand financial investments and the associated risks</h3>\n<p>With experts from the Centre for Financial and Management Studies at SOAS University of London, you’ll look at practical examples of financial investments, to examine:</p>\n\n<ul><li>the main functions of finance and of risk management </li>\n<li>the main forms of financial investment, such as stocks and bonds, derivatives, futures and options, hedging and speculation strategies</li>\n<li>how firms hedge risk by using financial derivatives</li>\n<li>how risk management is applied in the financial and in the non-financial sector.</li> </ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-how-the-financial-crisis-and-emerging-markets-are-changing-risk-management\">Learn how the financial crisis and emerging markets are changing risk management</h3>\n<p>The course will explore how finance has changed in recent years, and ask if these changes have resulted in greater systemic risk for the financial sector and for the economy as a whole. By examining concepts such as behavioural finance, we’ll ask if inappropriate risk management has exacerbated the recent financial crisis.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we’ll turn our attention to new and emerging markets. For example, how is risk managed in Islamic finance? How might common tools alter risk in investment positions in mature markets as well as in the banking sector? And how can firms utilise risk management tools most effectively?</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the four-week course, you’ll be able to:</p>\n\n<ul><li>understand financial markets and the principles of risk management</li>\n<li>understand the main types of risk and evaluate the methods and tools used by firms to manage risks</li> \n<li>examine ideas and methods used in the analysis of portfolios of financial securities, including stocks and bonds</li>\n<li>explain the use of financial derivatives for hedging (reducing risk) and speculation (increasing risk) in financial markets</li> \n<li>evaluate the application of risk methods and risk management tools in the global economy</li></ul>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management"],"educator":"Pasquale Scaramozzino","organisation":{"url":"http://www.soas.ac.uk/","name":"SOAS University of London","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f4/da/f4daa6f0-4cbb-464d-909f-7eb155b67d82.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7807006/video","runs":[{"uuid":"8e0b48cf-8885-4bcd-aaef-2d81dcd57e4f","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"3490383e-830b-4da8-b867-c402be84d50b","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/digital-accessibility?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/8a/ac/regular_8aac90ee-f4fe-4f7d-b079-583013748ce1.jpg","name":"Digital Accessibility: Enabling Participation in the Information Society","introduction":"With a better understanding of users' needs, technologies can be developed to be accessible & provide a more inclusive environment","description":"<p>This course will help you to understand how those with sensory, physical and cognitive impairments may be disabled by barriers encountered when using digital technologies.

The reading load will be flexible, and you will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and feelings via the online discussions with other learners.</p>\n\n<p>Together, we’ll explore six themes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Stress:</strong> In poetry, the word “stress” refers to the emphasis of certain syllables in a poem’s metre. How might the metrical “stresses” of poetry help us to cope with the mental and emotional stresses of modern life?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Heartbreak:</strong> Is heartbreak a medical condition? What can Sidney’s sonnets and Austen’s <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> teach us about suffering and recovering from a broken heart?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Bereavement:</strong> The psychologist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross famously proposed that there are five stages of grief. How might Shakespeare’s <em>Hamlet</em> and poems by Wordsworth and Hardy help us to think differently about the process of grieving?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Trauma:</strong> PTSD or “shellshock” has long been associated with the traumatic experiences of soldiers in World War 1. How is the condition depicted in war poetry of the era? Can poems and plays offer us an insight into other sources of trauma, including miscarriage and assault?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Depression and Bipolar:</strong> The writer Rachel Kelly subtitles her memoir <em>Black Rainbow</em> “how words healed me – my journey through depression”. Which texts have people turned to during periods of depression, and why? What can we learn from literature about the links between bipolar disorder and creativity?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Ageing and Dementia:</strong> One of the greatest studies of ageing in English Literature is Shakespeare’s <em>King Lear</em>. Is it helpful to think about this play in the context of dementia? Why are sufferers of age-related memory loss often still able to recall the poems they have learned “by heart”?</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Leading you through the course and readings will be:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Dr Paula Byrne:</strong> One of the world’s leading Jane Austen experts, who conceived of this course while researching how Austen’s novels were prescribed to victims of shellshock in World War 1.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Professor Jonathan Bate:</strong> A critic, biographer and reviewer; Man Booker Prize judge; and author of a prize-winning biography of the poet, John Clare, and <em>Being Shakespeare</em> - the hit one-man play for Simon Callow. Jonathan is also the Lead Educator on the immensely successful <em><a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world\">Shakespeare and his World</a></em> FutureLearn course.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Along the way, you’ll also hear from doctors, who offer a medical perspective on the conditions discussed in the course, as well as from a range people who have turned to literature at moments of crisis, including such well-known figures as Melvyn Bragg, Ian McKellen and Stephen Fry.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll have the opportunity to share your own experiences, discover new texts, and take part in activities that explore the relationship between reading and wellbeing.

Here are just a few of the wonderful comments learners have said about the course so far:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I [have] loved this course, thank you. It has reminded me of the power of words to lift us up and that express emotions and conditions that can be hard to deal with. I have been inspired to read and write more poetry as a result. Thank you again!” - Susan Perry</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Thoroughly enjoyed the course and found it really rewarding. Excellent content and food for thought. I can’t praise it highly enough. I’m now totally convinced about the impact literature can have on mental health. I know it will help more people in future - literature, art and music has a tremendous power to help healing and promote mental well-being. It is a lifeline and a wonderful coping mechanism. It’s been great to learn from and share experiences with all the delegates too.” - Dr. Rachael Turner</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I have have enjoyed this course immensely. It’s given me a new outlook on life and even the courage to read new and exciting things and to even enjoy a wider range of materials I’ve ever thought of.

The complement of metabolites in a biological system is known as the metabolome and represents the downstream effect of an organism’s genome and its interaction with the environment. Metabolomics has a wide application area across the medical and biological sciences and is attractive to both new and established scientists. In this course we will provide an introduction to metabolomics, explain why we want to study the metabolome and describe the current challenges in analysing the complement of metabolites in a biological system.

They are instruments of communication and are often a source of dignity and of human pride. Our life experiences and views of the world are bound up in our languages. Our sense of self might be strengthened by our ability to speak the language we choose or curtailed by our inability to understand the language that speaks to us.

But occasionally, these feelings can develop into more long-lasting mental health difficulties, including anxiety and depression. Around a quarter of the population are directly affected each year by mental health difficulties where more specialist help and support is needed. This course offers an insight into two of the most commonly diagnosed mental health difficulties: anxiety and depression.</p>\n\n<p>This five week course will improve your understanding and knowledge around depression and anxiety, dispel some common myths about these disorders, and introduce you to a leading, effective treatment for both disorders, called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (or ‘CBT’ for short).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understanding-depression-and-anxiety\">Understanding depression and anxiety</h3>\n\n<p>Getting to grips with depression and anxiety is a learning journey.  In order to fully understand these difficulties we first need to understand how we process and make sense of the world around us, and how our emotional state may play an active role in this process. During the first week, we will explore this in more detail and there will be opportunities to consolidate your learning with a number of relevant practical activities.</p>\n\n<p>We will then look at depression and anxiety in turn, and will consider: how these disorders differ from ‘normal’ emotional states, highlight associated signs and symptoms, and explore some of the factors which may be responsible for maintaining these difficulties using a cognitive behavioural framework.</p>\n\n<p>The final two weeks will be devoted to illustrating how CBT can be used to treat depression and anxiety.\nEach week you’ll have the opportunity to engage in activities to help you apply the knowledge you gain on the course. There will be information to download, and interviews with experts and patients to help you understand more about these common disorders and one of the ways in which they can be successfully treated.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to emphasise that this online course is not intended to be a self-help ‘treatment’ for anyone experiencing anxiety or depression, nor can the information within it be used to formally ‘diagnose’ yourself or anyone else displaying symptoms of anxiety or depression.

Seasonal influenza returns each winter, killing up to half a million people in bad years and causing much misery. Pandemic influenza, by contrast, is rare - having occurred only a handful of times in the last century - and far worse than seasonal flu, often killing many millions across the world. The worst pandemic of all, the “Spanish Flu” of 1918, killed over twice as many people as the First World War - some estimates are even higher.</p>\n\n<p>Since 1918, our understanding of influenza virus has come a long way. We can now trace how the pandemics of the last hundred years originated in bird flu and swine flu, and we can model the evolution of the virus from year to year, aiding vaccine design. We also have some anti-viral drugs that can be used in emergencies, and we understand more about how flu is transmitted and possible ways to prevent its spread.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will cover everything from the history of influenza to modern laboratory diagnostics and vaccination. You’ll learn about the annual cycle that brings seasonal flu to our shores every winter, and also how avian and pig flus can contribute to the emergence of new pandemic strains of flu.</p>\n\n<p>We’ll also look at the structure of the virus in more detail, seeing how the study of influenza is now carried out at the molecular level.</p>\n\n<p>As well as mini-lectures, there will be laboratory demonstrations, interviews with experts in a variety of relevant fields, and discussion sessions, where you’ll be invited to contribute your own experiences and opinions to the subject of flu, and how we should treat and prevent it.</p>\n\n<p>You can find out more in Dr Derek Gatherer’s post for the FutureLearn blog: “<a href=\"https://about.futurelearn.com/blog/do-i-have-the-flu/\">Do I have the flu?

This has a huge impact on individuals and on society, so improvements in understanding, care and treatments are desperately needed.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course you’ll discover some of the key issues in dementia care and research by exploring four less common forms of dementia through the eyes of people affected by the condition, and world-leading experts at UCL. We’ll show how research into the signs, stages, symptoms and causes of less common forms can bring us closer to the aim of defeating dementia.</p>\n\n<p><em>“I work in a care home with people living with dementia.

In the four weeks of this course we’ll investigate four forms of dementia that are important to understand better in their own right (they’re often not well recognised), but can also provide important insights that change how we think about dementia in general.  We will also make the point that dementia affects younger people too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 1 – What if dementia runs in the family?</strong><br>\nExplore the challenges that face families - and ground-breaking research taking place - with people affected by <strong>familial Alzheimer’s disease</strong>, where the condition runs in the family and often starts at a young age.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 2 – What if dementia affects behaviour and personality?</strong><br>\nDementia is not just about memory loss – we investigate the particular challenges for diagnosis and care for people with <strong>behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 3 – What if dementia makes you see things that aren’t there?</strong><br>\nSome people with dementia experience hallucinations, and many describe fluctuations in their symptoms over time. These aspects are particularly clear in <strong>dementia with Lewy bodies</strong>, which you’ll learn about in Week 3.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Week 4 – What if dementia affects your vision, not your memory?</strong> \nPeople with <strong>posterior cortical atrophy</strong> experience changes in the way the brain processes visual information; we’ll explore this condition and the research taking place to help people live better with visual impairment related to dementia.</p>\n\n<p><em>“The combination of personal stories paralleled by information given by expert clinicians and researchers was very engaging and, coupled with a multitude of interesting comments from course participants, provided a very well-rounded insight into the realities of dementia.” Anne Brink, learner in March 2016</em></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"learn-from-dementia-experts-experts-by-experience-and-each-other\">Learn from dementia experts, experts by experience and each other</h4>\n<p>This course is presented by experts from the UCL Institute of Neurology and Division of Psychiatry who are highly regarded for their work as scientists and clinicians. Importantly, you’ll hear from people who have been diagnosed with dementia, and people who care for a family member with dementia to get a better understanding of the impact that a diagnosis of dementia brings.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll be able to understand how dementia affects people by watching video interviews, look deeper into the topics by reading articles, interact through activities and questions, and also learn from others on the course by taking part in the discussions that accompany each step.

Through books, an abundance of information, including the knowledge and experiences of the people of the past, has been handed down to the present. But books are more than records of words and images. Their form, appearance, and even the scripts and styles used tell us about the fashions and technologies of the times that produced them. By studying old books, we can learn a great deal about the geographical areas in which they were made, the historical background, and the individuals and groups involved in their making.</p>\n\n<p>While displaying remarkable similarities with books produced in other areas of the Sinitic cultural sphere, Japanese books also possess some unique features, starting with their sheer diversity of form and appearance. Using a wealth of multimedia content, we will take a journey through the wonderful world of traditional Japanese books.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"keio-universitys-book-collection\">Keio University’s Book Collection</h2>\n<p>Keio University’s Institute of Oriental Classics is a unique institution specialized in rare East Asian books.

In this course we will make use of this rich collection and rely on the expertise of specialists and researchers who have been working for the preservation and study of these resources. Using state of the art media resources, you will familiarize yourself with not only the content of traditional East Asian books, but also with their physical appearance, format, binding method, script, and cover style.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-about-bookbinding-styles-and-their-influence-on-japanese-literature\">Learn about bookbinding styles and their influence on Japanese literature</h2>\n<p>In the first week of the course, you will be introduced to the main bookbinding methods used in traditional Asia, and to the practice of rebinding books.

These tools and the problems that they address are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>eigenvalues and eigenvectors for ranking</li>\n  <li>graph Laplacian for clustering</li>\n  <li>singular value decomposition for data compression.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"develop-your-analysis-skills-with-prototypical-case-studies\">Develop your analysis skills with prototypical case studies</h3>\n\n<p>In this course, we have chosen a number of prototypical problems in data analytics to demonstrate the main concepts. These algorithms can be extended to facilitate their use in big data problems.</p>\n\n<p>Our hands-on approach will allow you to develop your analytic skills using self-contained datasets, deepen your understanding of the underlying mathematical methods, and explore how these methods can be applied to big data in your area.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"continue-learning-with-the-big-data-analytics-program\">Continue learning with the Big Data Analytics program</h3>\n\n<p>This course is one of four in the <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/programs/big-data-analytics\">Big Data Analytics</a> program on FutureLearn from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers at Queensland University of Technology (QUT).</p>\n\n<p>The program enables you to understand how big data is collected and managed, before exploring statistical inference, machine learning, mathematical modelling and data visualisation.</p>\n\n<p>When you complete all four courses and buy a <a href=\"https://www.futurelearn.com/proof-of-learning/certificate-of-achievement\">Certificate of Achievement</a> for each, you will earn a FutureLearn Award as proof of completing the program of study.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h2>\n<p>QUT would like to thank the following content contributors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Kevin Burrage</li>\n  <li>Giuseppe De Martino</li>\n  <li>Steve Psaltis</li>\n  <li>Ian Turner</li>\n</ul>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","Online & Digital"],"educator":"Ian Turner","organisation":{"url":"https://www.qut.edu.au/","name":"Queensland University of Technology","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ec/42/ec42e922-7ca3-4e87-8920-d1e626edf009.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/6516800/video","runs":[{"uuid":"efdbe448-d9a9-4707-b893-42af2c70ded1","start_date":"2016-05-30","duration_in_weeks":2},{"uuid":"f9ab41a8-45dd-48fe-ab17-629ebb8bc8b9","start_date":"2016-10-03","duration_in_weeks":2}]},{"uuid":"728da618-4084-4da4-a950-5bb5d8c14160","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/big-data-visualisation?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f8/b3/regular_f8b3141c-0458-4c45-8604-37494ad156c6.jpg","name":"Big Data: Data Visualisation","introduction":"Data visualisation is vital in bridging the gap between data and decisions.

Deze cursus gaat in op de vraag wat recht is en waar je het kunt vinden.\r\n","description":"<p>Het recht regelt vrijwel alle aspecten van de maatschappij. Soms is dat heel zichtbaar: je komt het tegen in de rechtszaal bij een zaak tegen een grote crimineel of in de Tweede Kamer bij een verhit debat over een nieuw wetsvoorstel. Het recht regelt ook kleinere - maar belangrijke - dingen, zoals het huurcontract van je nieuwe woning of je arbeidsovereenkomst.</p>\n\n<p>Het recht is daarnaast voor een groot deel ‘onzichtbaar’. Als je bijvoorbeeld de dagelijkse boodschappen afrekent bij de kassa, ben je jezelf er wellicht niet direct van bewust dat er steeds een wederkerige verbintenisscheppende overeenkomst tot stand komt tussen jou en de supermarkt. Daaruit vloeien veel meer rechten en plichten voort dan alleen het leveren van de boodschappen en het betalen daarvoor.</p>\n\n<p>Juist omdat het recht zo veel invloed heeft op het leven van alledag, komt enige juridische kennis steeds van pas.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ben je in het recht geïnteresseerd, bijvoorbeeld omdat je daarmee in je werk- of privéomgeving regelmatig in aanraking komt?</li>\n  <li>Ben je op zoek naar de juiste studie, of wil je binnen je eigen studie je horizon verbreden?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Dan is deze introducerende cursus interessant voor jou!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-tijdens-deze-cursus-gaat-doen\">Wat je tijdens deze cursus gaat doen</h3>\n<p>Door middel van video’s, artikelen, oefenvragen en discussies maak je de komende vijf weken jouw eerste stappen in de wereld van het recht.</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>eerste week</strong> legt de basis waarop we de rest van de weken voortbouwen. Wat is recht? Waar kun je het vinden? Hoe kun je het vinden? Je gaat zelf wetten en rechterlijke uitspraken opzoeken, lezen en gebruiken om je argumenten bij een juridische zaak goed te onderbouwen. Deze vaardigheden komen niet alleen gedurende deze cursus van pas, maar ook al direct in het dagelijks leven!</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>tweede week</strong> gaat over een heel zichtbaar deel van het recht: het staatsrecht. Wie maakt de regels? Hoe verhoudt de Tweede Kamer zich tot de regering? Je gaat op ontdekkingsreis in de Grondwet en leert wat de uitwerking is van grondrechten. Is het ene grondrecht belangrijker dan het andere? Betekent de vrijheid van meningsuiting dat je alles mag zeggen? En zijn er mensen die méér mogen zeggen dan anderen?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>derde week</strong> leer je meer over schade en aansprakelijkheid. Waarom kun je beter niet zomaar een kelderluik in een café open laten staan? En waarom moet je soms toch iemands schade vergoeden terwijl het niet jouw schuld was? En – ook belangrijk – wanneer hoeft dat niet?</p>\n\n<p>In de <strong>vierde week</strong> leer je wanneer en hoe je jezelf kunt verweren tegen de machtige overheid. Hoe ziet ‘het bestuur’ van ons land er precies uit? En wat kun je doen als je van de burgemeester geen project X-feestje mag houden? Of als je geen bouwvergunning voor een nieuwe dakkapel krijgt?</p>\n\n<p>De <strong>vijfde week</strong> gaat over een onderdeel van het recht waar je waarschijnlijk meteen aan denkt bij het woord ‘recht’: het strafrecht. Er komen vragen aan de orde als: wanneer bega je een strafbaar feit? Kun je de staf ontlopen door een ‘vormfout’? Wanneer en hoe intensief mag je jezelf of een ander verdedigen tegen een aanval?</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wat-je-na-deze-cursus-kunt\">Wat je na deze cursus kunt</h3>\n<p>Na afloop van de cursus ben je in staat om:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>uit te leggen wat ‘recht’ is aan de hand van de functies, de bronnen en de indeling van het recht;</li>\n  <li>verschillende rechtsgebieden van elkaar te onderscheiden;</li>\n  <li>enkele juridische basisbegrippen te herkennen en te beschrijven;</li>\n  <li>wetgeving en uitspraken van rechters op te zoeken en op elementair niveau te analyseren;</li>\n  <li>basale juridische problemen op te lossen en de oplossing te motiveren aan de hand van wetsartikelen en rechterlijke uitspraken.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Schrijf je nu in en doe mee!</strong></p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Law"],"educator":"Adriaan Wierenga","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8118661/video","runs":[{"uuid":"dcd2dac1-8fa9-49ea-8e7e-cacf3c34d772","start_date":"2016-05-30","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"7be445d6-0eb7-4607-affd-b4e06bc7ee79","start_date":"2016-11-07","duration_in_weeks":5},{"uuid":"50f7f339-9f44-4809-824c-3ddeba4b11d8","start_date":"2017-03-13","duration_in_weeks":5}]},{"uuid":"030d43f9-19f7-41c6-887e-07c44e957512","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/animal-viruses?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/76/2d/regular_762d9cfc-95fb-4d68-aaf1-10a747d1d251.jpg","name":"Animal Viruses: Their Transmission and the Diseases They Produce","introduction":"Learn how important animal viruses are transmitted between animals and humans, and understand the diseases they produce.\r\n","description":"<p>In this free online course, you will learn about animal viruses that affect pets, birds, sheep, cattle, swine and horses, and produce important diseases.</p>\n\n<p>These animal diseases may cause huge economic losses to farmers and severe emotional distress to animal owners.

A number of Chinese artists have responded to these issues through powerful art.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"discover-extraordinary-works-created-by-chinese-artists\">Discover extraordinary works created by Chinese artists</h2>\n<p>These artists have created site-specific performances in lakes, rivers, and mountains to raise environmental consciousness; they have written songs and plays for millions of migrant workers, to address the issue of inequality; they have organized parades and festivals for villagers, to make the processes of rural governance visible. These artists not only contribute to social change, they also push the boundaries of contemporary art. They challenge the conventional modes of artistic production and reception.</p>\n\n<p>In this course we will look at a number of art projects that address important social issues. We will study how they integrate aesthetic concerns with social concerns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-chinese-art-projects-in-depth\">Explore Chinese art projects in depth</h2>\n<p>China is massive. It means on this course, we won’t be able to discuss every socially engaged artwork created in China over the past few decades. Instead, we will dive deep into a number of projects that are substantial, and representative of this exciting field. The focus of this course is not only on why the artists initiated these projects, but also on how they developed their ideas, overcame challenges, and pushed artistic boundaries.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-inspired-by-experts-artists-and-other-learners\">Get inspired by experts, artists and other learners</h2>\n<p>The lead educator for this course is Dr. Zheng Bo, an expert in Chinese socially engaged art. He leads the “Socially Engaged Art in Contemporary China” research project at the School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong. In addition to course videos, you will also watch artist interviews, study visual materials, and participate in discussions. Through these varied learning you will gain a deeper understanding of contemporary China and of contemporary art.</p>\n\n<p>In fact we hope you will also be inspired to create your own socially engaged art, to address something that matters to you in your community.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media","Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Bo ZHENG","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cityu.edu.hk","name":"City University of Hong Kong","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/42/ba/42ba712c-64a5-4266-8a71-ad3f1a2a3b32.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7828318/video","runs":[{"uuid":"09719f84-64d3-4e3c-b71f-b2add420daa4","start_date":"2017-02-06","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"66e1c2a8-0d12-4e22-a7c3-5f2c401b09ff","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/cambridge-english-ielts?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/41/13/regular_41132d90-45a7-4073-af9c-f910c5ed57b5.jpg","name":"Inside IELTS: Preparing for the Test with the Experts","introduction":"Learn about the skills you need for IELTS Academic and beyond, on this free online course from the experts who produce the test.","description":"<ul>\n  <li>What skills are important for success in the IELTS Academic test?</li>\n  <li>How do IELTS examiners assess your level?</li>\n  <li>What do you need to do in order to improve your IELTS band score?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This five-week course will help you find answers to questions like these.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-advice-from-the-ielts-experts\">Get advice from the IELTS experts</h2>\n<p>This free online course is created by Cambridge English Language Assessment (part of the University of Cambridge), who produce the IELTS test.</p>\n\n<p>You will have many opportunities to interact with experts and with other learners from around the world.

We’ll also discuss how research underway at Newcastle University addresses these topics.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Privacy online:</strong>  What is privacy? We begin by looking into our own beliefs and practices when it comes to giving out our data online. What is the value of our personal data to businesses? And how can you find out what information about you is readily available online?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Payment safety:</strong> We make payments everyday, we purchase items at the store and we purchase items online, but how secure are these payments?  How safe is our money?   All of the different methods of payment cash, credit/debit card, cheque and bitcoin are a trade-off between security and convenience.   We will look at constantly evolving race between the payment fraud and the security measures employed to prevent fraud.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Security at home:</strong> With increasing numbers of autonomous, internet-enabled devices in our homes and cars, on our wrists and in our clothes, how could they be misused?

New illnesses seem to spread faster than ever thanks to interconnected ecosystems and the close connections between humans and animals. Stressing this interconnectedness, One Health seeks an integrative approach to human and animal health. This course will explore this approach and examine the value of it - as well as explain how One Health strategies work in practice.</p>\n\n<p>In this free online course, we will attempt to answer some key questions, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What are the many advantages of a closer cooperation between human and animal health?</li>\n  <li>What transdisciplinary processes can be set up to solve a particular One Health problem efficiently?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"understand-the-concept-of-one-health\">Understand the concept of One Health</h5>\n\n<p>The One Health concept has gained momentum in recent decades, spurred for instance by the Avian Influenza pandemic or by concerns regarding wildlife conservation. Growing interest and practical engagement in academia, non-governmental organisations and national and local governments can be observed widely. After this course you’ll be able to not only explain what One Health is, you’ll be able to explain how this engagement is carried out, for example in collection of vaccination coverage data or food safety enhancement. In addition you’ll also be able to reflect on interdisciplinary ideas that can solve everyday One Health problems.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"explore-the-value-of-one-health\">Explore the value of One Health</h5>\n\n<p>Practicing One Health not only improves human and animal health but also allows considerable financial savings and contributes to a better environment. This value cannot be achieved working alone, but rather is a triumph of truly interdisciplinary and intersectoral work. The course reflects this and brings together different disciplines in a selection of case studies, demonstrating the advantages of a closer cooperation between human and animal health and social and cultural sciences. You will learn how to calculate the added value resulting from this approach.</p>\n\n<p>We are very happy to announce that in this course you may take part in a competition in order <strong>to win one of three travel grants</strong>.

Consider, for example, the long-standing Sino-Japanese rivalry and the unresolved territorial disputes in the East China Sea. It is often said that the territorial disputes between Tokyo and Beijing have reached a ‘boiling point.’ Also, the persistent security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear weapons and long-range missiles cannot be taken lightly. Most of all, the rise of China and the United States’  “rebalance” toward Asia is likely to generate a new dimension of global power politics.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-regional-cooperation-and-economy\">Explore regional cooperation and economy</h2>\n<p>From a global economic perspective, however, Northeast Asia is a region of cooperation and interdependence. For example, the share of intra-regional trade between China, Japan and Korea increased from 12.3% in 1990 to 22.5% in 2010. China is largest trading partner of both South Korea and Japan. South Korea is China’s third largest trading partner. In addition, two-way trade between Japan and China had reached $340 billion in 2014, and the stock of Japanese investment in China had reached $100 billion in 2014, that is $30 billion more than the next largest investor — the United States.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"contemplate-the-future-of-south-korea\">Contemplate the future of South Korea</h2>\n<p>South Korea faces both challenges and opportunities in such a dynamic region as East Asia. Furthermore, academics and policymakers alike tend to agree that the dominant issues of the twenty-first century would be decided in Asia-Pacific. As such, South Korea’s national interests will be shaped by how it perceives and approaches the political and economic issues of East Asia and (by extension) Asia-Pacific.

Understanding who is important to an organisation – and that’s everybody who has a stake in it in some way – is a really good starting point. Building relationships with interested groups and people is time well spent. So too is time spent on planning. As someone once said ‘To fail to plan is to plan to fail’. If there’s no plan, how do organisations get people on board? If there’s no plan, what’s the difference between success and failure?  How do you know when things are going off track? Or going well?</p>\n\n<p>Plans are one thing. The people who can make the plans a reality are those with the right knowledge, skills and experience. Without the right person, performing as well as they can in the right job, plans don’t get off the ground. So building, supporting, growing and developing a team is much of what leading and managing is all about.   And sometimes that’s about tackling poor performance, which can be uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"develop-a-business-plan-and-build-an-effective-team\">Develop a business plan and build an effective team</h3>\n\n<p>This four-week course will guide you through the some key aspects of leadership and management.

They also like to look for ‘cause and effect’, reducing action and reaction to defined components. However, complex patterns in ecology are not always causal and predictable. Populations have their own dynamics that can be independent of external environmental conditions.</p>\n\n<p>Although living systems are complex, there are also some clear patterns and simple relationships that appear to be fairly constant.

Needless to say, these phenomena have profound social implications that may harm future generations.</p>\n\n<p>This situation raises some major ethical questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>To what extent are human beings entitled to exploit nature for their needs and interests?</li>\n  <li>What kind of shared responsibility is appropriate in addressing climate change?</li>\n  <li>How can we respond to the adverse effects of climate change being experienced by the peoples of the Global South?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The effects of climate change disasters, however, are not only confined to the global south but are also felt by the more affluent sectors of societies or the Global North.</p>\n\n<p>In order to achieve a more sustainable world where nature can continue to support the aspirations for better living conditions for future and disadvantaged generations, a notion of justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature and the human beings’ rights to live and enjoy the fruits of their labor must be formulated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-about-climate-justice\">Learn about climate justice</h2>\n\n<p>Following the recommendation of UNESCO’s World Commission for the Ethics of Science and Technology (COMEST) in the promotion of Biological and Cultural Diversity as starting point of Climate Change Ethics, UNESCO is currently pioneering a worldwide reflection on the ‘ethical principles in relation to climate change’. Along the same line, within its philosophy programme, in 2014 UNESCO published the <a href=\"http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002284/228411E.pdf\">“Manual of Philosophy – A South-South Perspective”</a>. This Manual sheds a new light on the singularity of some major philosophical texts and traditions from the Global South.</p>\n\n<p>This course has been built upon these two major undertakings. It will propose a notion of climate justice that balances the ecological integrity of nature, on the one hand, while supporting the biological and economic needs of human populations, on the other hand.  Human needs and ecological integrity, therefore, need not be opposing but more supportive of one another in so far as human beings allow nature to regenerate herself by regulating their excessive consumption of natural resources.</p>\n\n<p>The course proposes groundbreaking reflections on Climate Justice, within the contexts of Biological and Cultural Diversity and the Precautionary Principle, while exploring the Global South’s approaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-how-humans-can-balance-their-needs-with-the-needs-of-the-planet\">Explore how humans can balance their needs with the needs of the planet</h2>\n\n<p>At the end of the course, you’ll learn about the various practices of frugality in the global south and enable you to adapt these practices to your own circumstances in view of contributing to the needs of the most vulnerable populations of society.</p>\n\n<p>You will also be able to imagine different ways of extracting natural resources without compromising the regenerating capacity of nature to sustain herself and thus continuously support the needs of all human beings.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":2,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Nature & Environment","Politics & the Modern World"],"educator":"Rainier Ibana","organisation":{"url":"http://en.unesco.org/","name":"UNESCO","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/21/0e/210e513f-d31a-4ae0-b47d-32092897bf56.png"},"runs":[{"uuid":"f459df50-d603-4186-9130-cafdb9060f35","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":4},{"uuid":"1a2e04eb-93c5-4e88-b242-3067d2eda6cc","start_date":null,"duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"80b46e3a-fece-46a5-8105-2e3dd5e1ca57","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/european-culture?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/7f/6c/regular_7f6cbd08-46c5-447f-8069-4286928bd5ec.jpg","name":"European Culture and Politics","introduction":"Learn about the link between identity, culture and politics in the construction of contemporary Europe. \r\n","description":"<p>This free online course explains what Europe is, not as a geographically demarcated territory, but as a cultural and political product.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-european-culture-and-politics--and-todays-key-challenges\">Explore European culture and politics – and today’s key challenges</h3>\n\n<p>The course is a collaborative work of a multidisciplinary team from the University of Groningen, in partnership with the Universities of Göttingen, Uppsala and the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. We will revisit and tackle the perceived “truths” about the meaning of European identity and Europeanness. We will examine the ways in which cultural knowledge and facts were constructed to further integration processes in post-World War II Europe.</p>\n\n<p>You will analyse and explain the intertwined relationship between culture and politics in constructing and governing contemporary Europe. You will gain deep understanding of how struggles over the meaning of Europe have shaped European contemporary society and how they will shape Europe’s future. We will help you understand and identify the complexities of the contemporary crises of European integration and support you in developing novel responses to these crises.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"develop-your-intercultural-communication-skills-with-researchers-and-learners-throughout-europe\">Develop your intercultural communication skills with researchers and learners throughout Europe</h3>\n\n<p>The course has been developed by the <a href=\"http://euroculturemaster.eu\" title=\"Euroculture\">Euroculture programme</a>, which conducts research and runs a multi-university master’s programme on European culture and politics.</p>\n\n<p>By joining this course and discussing your ideas with thousands of other learners across and beyond Europe, you will develop your intercultural communication skills and gain experience of discussing controversial and complex issues honestly and respectfully.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>first week</strong>, you will examine Europe as a cultural project. You will learn how European culture is imagined and constructed by European institutions via the EU’s language policy or the Capital of Culture programme, but also how these top-down interventions into the meaning of Europe are challenged by local/grass-root cultural practices and interventions.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>second week</strong>, you will look at the role religion plays in European politics and societies. You will revisit the role of religion in European public spheres and you will critically examine secularisation and the idea of a secular Europe.You will see if Europe can be identified through a particular religion (or absence of religion). And you will see how religion has been used to identify what is Europe and what is not Europe</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>third week</strong> considers Europe’s relationship with modernity. Europe is often held as a standard: it is where modern science developed, where modern political systems came into being and where modern literary genres were invented. You will look at the assumptions behind and implications of this idea of modernity.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>fourth week</strong>, we turn to the nation-state. Although the EU is often said to be the anti-thesis of the nation-state, some have argued that it has actually saved it. You will examine the EU as an unique experiment in the creation of a post-national political entity. You will also be asked to rethink the existing forms of political organisation in Europe and propose sustainable solutions for problems linked to integration beyond the nation state.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>fifth week</strong> examines how Europe is constructed as a democratic space. You will see how European political integration has been furthered and legitimised through a particular reading of democracy. Focus is placed on challenges and possible solutions to the construction of democracy in a post-national society.</p>\n\n<p>In the <strong>sixth week</strong> you will examine how European identity is constructed via practices of othering; claims of what Europe is not. By addressing the question of Europe’s other we will not only gain a better perspective on how Europe is imagined but also whose voices remain silent/marginalised in this process. If we want to build a more inclusive Europe – and we do – critical questions of who is Europe’s other and how is Europe imagined by this other – need to be addressed.</p>\n\n<p>After completing this course, you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>describe how European political integration is embedded in broader cultural modalities such as language or memory;</li>\n<li>explain Europe as a multifaceted and ever-changing entity;</li>\n<li>define the main transdisciplinary debates on Europe and European identity;</li>\n<li>understand deeper and more underlying roots of contemporary problems of Europe integration;\n</li><li>propose innovative sustainable solutions to these problems;</li>\n<li>debate sensitive topics in a culturally and academically diverse environment. </li>\n\n</ul>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":5,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Politics & the Modern World","Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Senka Neuman","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7464372/video","runs":[{"uuid":"48fb1a89-41f0-4469-8e91-34ef3add2a36","start_date":"2016-09-26","duration_in_weeks":6}]},{"uuid":"cd299146-3a1a-45f1-a5c3-0e12f788de0a","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/medical-humanity?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/ca/fa/regular_cafa032e-cce6-4658-9f49-ab408bc34bb3.jpg","name":"Medical Humanity: Engaging Patients and Communities in Healthcare ","introduction":"Find out how and why you should engage patients and communities in the development of new healthcare technology and treatments.","description":"<p>The development of healthcare treatments has given people hope to fight diseases.

Or how they make money to live their daily lives, just like other people?  This course will explore the <strong>process of creators becoming professionals</strong>: how a marketplace and an industry have grown thanks to inventions like the 15th century printing press.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll learn that this process began with the idea that artistic work is the property of creators and how this idea inspired a new industry based on <strong>copyright</strong>. You’ll also explore the various aspects of this process - looking at how technological enhancement, creativity and the legal dimensions of copyright are all closely linked.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"medieval-to-modern-understand-how-copyright-has-evolved\">Medieval to modern: understand how copyright has evolved</h2>\n\n<p>In the first week, you’ll contemplate the concept of a modern author connected by property rights to the works of art they create. We’ll look at how this connection evolved through time and how it was cemented in law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"explore-how-the-exchange-of-knowledge-became-global\">Explore how the exchange of knowledge became global</h2>\n\n<p>In the second week, we will focus on the 19th century. We will examine the increase in international commerce and in turn the increase in the exchange of knowledge and of ideas about authors and their rights. We’ll look at how this resulted in an <strong>International Convention for the protection of Authors’ Rights</strong> and the principles and justifications of this newly created international law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-how-the-world-wars-affected-war-years-and-mass-communication\">Learn how the World Wars affected War Years and Mass Communication</h2>\n\n<p>In the third week, we’ll move to the 20th century to face the big questions created by the World Wars. If the previous century saw increased cooperation for the exchange of knowledge and all kinds of intellectual goods, war showed the opposite. But at the same time the Industrial Revolution had introduced mechanical reproduction and the war efforts produced new technology like mass communication. This resulted in the start of <strong>art as industry</strong> - with new treaties and the recognition of rights to other individuals and companies, like performers, producers and broadcasters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"examine-digital-life-and-copyright\">Examine digital life and copyright</h2>\n\n<p>In the final week, we will talk about the new opportunities and challenges presented by <strong>digital technology</strong>. Never before have works protected by copyright had such a global reach and never before have creators had to deal with such a difficult equation regarding the value of their works. We’ll explore how the copyright industry finds itself in a reality where there is an unbalanced share of value between the creators of the work and the holders of the technology that make these works available globally.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Be familiar with the concepts of copyright and authors’ rights</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Be able to analyse further how copyright became a powerful tool in the marketplace for artistic work.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Build your understanding of the legal framework for the protection of creative work, comparing it to the common sense idea of artistic work as public good.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Propose methods to raise awareness of the legal protection system as an essential tool for building a fair trade market for creators.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Creative Arts & Media","History"],"educator":"Marisa Gandelman","organisation":{"url":"http://www.cisac.org/","name":"International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers (CISAC)","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/20/8d/208d5e11-6460-437d-b689-b3dde010e453.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8978635/video","runs":[{"uuid":"ed140f9c-9fdc-4214-93fb-a50bd2ac9b9f","start_date":"2017-03-20","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"d81cb10d-ea8f-48d4-a203-ac2222f79724","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/global-workplace?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f7/99/regular_f7999b42-e8a7-4e79-ba0b-fd3a025b156e.jpg","name":"How to Succeed in the Global Workplace","introduction":"Get off to a great start in your new job by learning the essential skills to succeed in a global workplace.","description":"<p>The British Council and The University of Sheffield have teamed up to help you succeed when you enter the workplace for the first time.

What can we do to tackle the issue?","description":"<p>The rapidly growing resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is one of the biggest crises currently facing humanity.  A recent UK government review indicated that if current trends continue, by 2050, infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens would lead to more deaths worldwide than cancer and return medicine to the Dark Ages.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-the-rise-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-the-food-chain\">Understand the rise of antibiotic resistance in the food chain</h3>\n\n<p>Antibiotics are not only an essential part of modern human medicine, they are also indispensable in veterinary medicine. Historically, low levels of antibiotics were added to the feed of healthy livestock, to promote their growth – a practice now banned in the European Union, but still in use elsewhere – while vets still use antibiotics to treat sick animals.</p>\n\n<p>This may have allowed potentially harmful bacteria to become steadily more resistant, including <em>E. coli</em>, <em>Salmonella</em> and <em>Campylobacter</em>, which can make their way from the farm to our dinner plates and lead to infections which may not be treatable.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"discover-how-we-can-tackle-antibiotic-resistance\">Discover how we can tackle antibiotic resistance</h3>\n\n<p>During this three-week course, we’ll study what antibiotics are, how they work, and how bacteria become resistant to their effects. We will look at how antibiotics are used every day from the perspective of a general practitioner (GP) and a veterinarian.</p>\n\n<p>We will then move on to look at how antibiotics are used in farming. How do antibiotics contaminate the environment? How can antibiotic-resistant bacteria find their way onto our food? What impact does global trade have on the spread of antibiotic resistance?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we consider what might be done to tackle antibiotic resistance. How effective are our current control measures and policies? What are we doing to look for new types of antibiotics? Are there alternatives to antibiotics? What can we do internationally to cooperate on solving this problem?</p>\n\n<p>By the end of the course, you should have all the information you need to make up your own mind about what we should do to tackle this immensely important problem.</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Science, Maths & Technology"],"educator":"Robert Atterbury","organisation":{"url":"http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/","name":"The University of Nottingham","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/85/98/859830d5-8de4-4323-a651-db513fa439f2.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/7992011/video","runs":[{"uuid":"aa2cb805-920c-42a1-9173-2ebcf92a85c0","start_date":"2016-11-14","duration_in_weeks":3}]},{"uuid":"dbb7b939-165c-48cd-94f7-4c52765706a1","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-uk-parliament?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/e4/98/regular_e498f864-4a56-41f0-9a44-4d9139752318.jpg","name":"Introduction to the UK Parliament: People, Processes and Public Participation","introduction":"Learn about the UK Parliament with this free online course - explore the work of Parliament and find out how it’s evolving.\r\n","description":"<p>This free online course will introduce you to the work and role of the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/\">UK Parliament</a>.

We will also examine and discuss the factors that can inhibit girls reaching their full potential in school and in their future careers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"get-guidance-on-helping-girls-achieve-their-potential\">Get guidance on helping girls achieve their potential</h2>\n\n<p>This course will give you practical steps to enhance the quality of learning for girls; after all, how pupils learn is as important as what they learn. We will examine different aspects of pedagogy that are ‘girl-friendly’ according to research and experience, and that also develop and promote character traits such as independence, resilience, collaborative working, problem solving and confidence.</p>\n\n<p>These approaches include: collaborative learning, challenge and problem solving, and ways of developing social interaction. You’ll then work on evaluating the impact of such approaches in your own school and identify any issues you might face.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learn-from-the-gdst\">Learn from the GDST</h2>\n\n<p>The GDST (Girls’ Day School Trust) is the leading group of independent girls’ schools in the UK, with nearly 4,000 staff, and 20,000 students between the ages of three and 18.

When financial disturbances have emerged at various times, the whole economy could be affected. Such turbulences have been observed in the slowing of economic growth and, occasionally, even political unrest.</p>\n\n<p>So, if business slumps and financial market turbulence have caused such big problems, why do they tend to re-emerge? Is there nothing to learn from history? During the course, we present five infamous downturns, which had a major impact when they occurred. As you will see during the course, although the downturns differed with regards to origin, impact, and persistence, they displayed certain common patterns and features. Such regularities, as well as the way the downturns have been managed, are highlighted in the course’s historical examples.</p>\n\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":4,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Business & Management","History"],"educator":"Jan Ottosson","organisation":{"url":"http://www.uu.se/en","name":"Uppsala University","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/f3/b5/f3b5e58d-4f7b-449c-8a79-1b5815fec8d3.png"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/8484345/video","runs":[{"uuid":"f52c1007-04f5-43b9-ad57-b403f071e999","start_date":"2017-02-20","duration_in_weeks":5}]},{"uuid":"c3b684cf-4920-468b-9a9c-a4641e9906dc","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/discovering-science-medicinal-chemistry?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/d1/fe/regular_d1feb619-e891-483d-ac7d-42f9e5ba1fae.jpg","name":"Discovering Science: Medicinal Chemistry","introduction":"What role does chemistry play in healthcare and our ability to diagnose and treat patients?","description":"<p>Discovering Science: Medicinal Chemistry explores the fascinating subject of science at the molecular level.

This controversial man was admired and scorned alike by some of the most enlightened minds in European culture. He was also one of the leading lights in the intellectual circles of the late 13th century, in which Arab, Jewish and Christian philosophers and scientists alike participated.</p>\n\n<p>Today he has acquired a new importance in the current debate on the ways knowledge is shared with others. In this course we’ll explore his work and how it’s influenced the arts, literature, science and technology.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"explore-the-work-of-ramon-llull-and-his-ars-combinatoria\">Explore the work of Ramon Llull and his <em>Ars Combinatoria</em></h3>\n\n<p><em>“Every philosopher has the ability to be a good mechanic.”</em></p>\n\n<p>Ramon Llull  invented a method of understanding knowledge that consisted of a complex mechanism of geometrical shapes and symbols that combine letters and concepts. It’s known as the <em>Ars combinatoria</em> and it was heralded as a new branch of learning with universal aspirations. The use of this mechanism, which posited the unity of the various branches of knowledge of the time, was intended to lead to peace between the religions by means of deduction, demonstration and dialogue.</p>\n\n<p>Llull sought to establish a complex model of reality that encompassed the world, humankind and God as if in a vast web.</p>\n\n<p>Through the course we’ll discover how Llull created this remarkable theory and understand more about his other work like <em>the Tree of Science</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"learn-about-the-life-of-ramon-llull\">Learn about the life of Ramon Llull</h3>\n\n<p>As well as exploring the work of Ramon Llull we’ll also look at this visionary’s life, examining the key events and circumstances which affected his work.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"understand-the-impact-of-ramon-llulls-work\">Understand the impact of Ramon Llull’s work</h3>\n\n<p>Finally we’ll look at the ways Ramon Llull’s work has influenced huge numbers of other thinkers: from artists and writers to inventors and theorists. In particular we’ll look at how Llull’s innovative philosophy regarding networks has contributed to modern ideas in this area.</p>\n\n<p>This course is inspired by the exhibition <a href=\"http://www.cccb.org/es/exposiciones/ficha/la-maquina-de-pensar/223672\">“The Thinking Machine.

In a world of globalisation, people who do not speak the same language meet more often every day. Being able to deal with these multilingual practices in an effective way can give you an advantage in your daily life and work .</p>\n\n<p>The main aim of this interactive course by the department of Frisian Language and Culture and Campus Fryslân of the University of Groningen is to deepen your understanding of the most important aspects of societal and individual multilingualism. Examples of the topics the course will be tackling are: what language ideologies arise in multilingual societies? How does multilingualism change the urban scenery around us? To what extent do families transmit their multiple languages to the following generations? What are the benefits and challenges of multilingual education? And what are recent trends in policy-making around multilingualism?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"who-is-this-course-for\">Who is this course for?</h2>\n<p>This course will thus cover a wide range of subjects, making it attractive for a broad audience. For instance, policy makers or other learners who are interested in how people speaking different languages can best be integrated will find out more about successful policies to support multilingualism in education and society. The same goes for teachers and parents who want to learn more about how to give multilingual children the best opportunities at developing their skills and talents and how multiple languages work in our mind.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"actual-practice\">Actual practice</h2>\n\n<p>The challenges that we will speak of will be recognisable for learners. The course will also introduce you to real families for whom multilingualism is an important factor in daily life. They will share their personal experiences with their multilingual situations with you, such as their doubt about whether they should teach their children their mother tongue or the language of the country they are living in - or both. The issues arising from the individual situations of our families will then be looked at from a scientific perspective. Every week, renowned experts in the field of multilingualism will comment on the central concepts of the week. In addition, you will read texts prepared also by key-researchers providing you with a summary of the field in question.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from the individual perspective of the families, the course highlights the challenges and opportunities of today’s multilingual societies. Current societal issues will thus be tackled: how can societies profit from their multilingual speakers? Or: how to design language policies that assure the protection of minority languages? These are questions that still must be answered in most of today’s globalised societies. The course will help you to look for your own answers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"course-outline\">Course outline</h2>\n\n<p>Over four weeks, this course will explore how multilingualism can work on personal, scientific and policy levels. We will look at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>linguistic landscape and policy;</li>\n<li>multilingualism at home and at work;</li>\n<li>multilingualism at school from a cognitive perspective;</li>\n<li>the position of minority languages and dialects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"learning-objectives\">Learning objectives</h2>\n\n<p>After following this course you will be able to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>identify central aspects around societal and individual multilingualism;</li>\n<li>evaluate the benefits of multilingualism of both minority and migrant speakers;</li>\n<li>recognise issues that arise when people who do not share the same languages meet;</li>\n<li>critically evaluate multilingual language policies for both migrant and minority languages;</li>\n<li>analyse multilingual practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The course will be taught in English by lecturers from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and leading experts in the field of Multilingualism will share their ideas with you! It includes quizzes, (research) activities, articles, discussions and videos. During the course we will hear different opinions and ideas about Multilingualism from experts in the field, but we want to hear yours too! What do you think of multilingual education? What is your position in the debate on the protection of minority languages?</p>\n\n<p>So, if you would like to share your views on Multilingualism and explore Multilingual Practices, join the course now!</p>\n","language":"en","hours_per_week":3,"has_certificates":true,"categories":["Languages & Cultures"],"educator":"Nanna H Hilton","organisation":{"url":"http://www.rug.nl/","name":"University of Groningen","logo_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/09/ef/09efb4b7-4fe8-43a3-9931-b41f6ca0490e.jpg"},"trailer":"//view.vzaar.com/9134361/video","runs":[{"uuid":"a032b76f-ea75-44d7-a4bc-da34a20d183b","start_date":"2017-04-10","duration_in_weeks":4}]},{"uuid":"8d83e1b6-f1d1-4d0f-ac20-0357fd67b4b2","url":"https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/assessments-student-outcomes?utm_campaign=Courses+feed&utm_medium=courses-feed&utm_source=courses-feed","image_url":"https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/4c/0f/regular_4c0fe3d6-1d75-4efe-a125-88c93e9b5219.jpg","name":"Designing Assessments to Measure Student Outcomes","introduction":"Design assessment instruments that use rubrics and surveys to measure student outcomes.
